Nested grouping symbols are when you have grouping symbols inside other grouping symbols.
When you see nested grouping symbols, you always start from the inside and work outwards.
Example 2
Evaluate $\{5-[11-(7-2)]\}+34$.
Solution
Start from the inside and work outwards:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\{5-[11-(\mathbf{7}-\mathbf{2})]\}+34 & =\{5-[\mathbf{1 1}-\mathbf{5}]\}+34 \\
& =\{\mathbf{5}-\mathbf{6}\}+34 \\
& =-1+34 \\
& =\mathbf{3 3}
\end{aligned}
$$
Guided Practice
Evaluate the following:
11. $8+[10+(6-9)+7]$
12. $9-\{[(-4)+10]+7\}$
13. $[(13-12)+6]-(4-2)$
14. $14-\{8+[5-(-2)]\}-6$
15. $13+[10-(4+5)]-(11+8)$
16. $10+\{[7-(-2)]-(3-1)\}+(-14)$

When you're simplifying expressions within grouping symbols, follow steps $2-4$ (see Example 3).
This order of operations is used by all mathematicians, so that every mathematician in the world evaluates expressions in the same way.
1. First calculate expressions within grouping symbols
- working from the innermost grouping symbols to the outermost.
2. Then calculate expressions involving exponents.
3. Next do all multiplication and division, working from left to right. Multiplication and division have equal priority, so do them in the order they appear from left to right.
4. Lastly, do any addition or subtraction, again from left to right. Addition and subtraction have the same priority, so do them in the order they appear from left to right too.
