Special Products of Two Binomials
California Standards:
2.0: Students understand and use such operations as taking the opposite, finding the reciprocal, taking a root, and raising to a fractional power. They understand and use the rules of exponents. 10.0: Students add, subtract, multiply, and divide monomials and polynomials. Students solve multistep problems, including word problems, by using these techniques.
11.0 Students apply basic factoring techniques to second and simple thirddegree polynomials. These techniques include finding a common factor for all terms in a polynomial, recognizing the difference of two squares, and recognizing perfect squares of binomials.
What it means for you: You'll learn how to use special cases of binomial multiplication to save time in calculations.
Key words:
- binomial
- difference of two squares

$(a+b)^{2}$ expands to give a perfect square trinomial see Topic 6.8.2.
This Topic is all about special cases of binomial multiplication. Knowing how to expand these special products will save you time when you're dealing with binomials later in Algebra I.

Remember These Three Special Binomial Products
Given any real numbers $a$ and $b$, then:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2} \\
(a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2} \\
(a+b)(a-b)=a^{2}-b^{2}
\end{array}
$$
When You Expand $(a+b)^{2}$, You Always Get an $a b$-Term
$$
\begin{aligned}
(\boldsymbol{a}+\boldsymbol{b})^{2} & =(a+b)(a+b) \\
& =a^{2}+a b+b a+b^{2} \quad \text { Using the distributive property } \\
& =\boldsymbol{a}^{2}+2 \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}+\boldsymbol{b}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
You can relate this equation to the area of a square:
$(a+b)^{2}$ is the same as the area of this large square - add the areas of the two smaller squares, $a^{2}$ and $b^{2}$, and the two rectangles, $2 \times a b$.
Example 1
Expand and simplify $(2 x+3)^{2}$.
Solution
Put the expression in the form $(a+b)(a+b)$ :
$$
\begin{aligned}
(2 x+3)^{2} & =(2 x+3)(2 x+3) \\
& =4 x^{2}+6 x+6 x+9 \\
& =4 x^{2}+\mathbf{1 2} x+9
\end{aligned}
$$
$(2 x+3)^{2}$ is the same as the area of the large square - add the areas of the two smaller squares, $4 x^{2}$ and 9 , and the two rectangles, $2 \times 6 x$.
