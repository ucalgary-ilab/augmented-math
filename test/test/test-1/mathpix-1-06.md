Borders of Regions
California Standards:
6.0: Students graph a linear equation and compute the $x$ and $y$-intercepts (e.g., graph $2 x+6 y=4$ ). They are also able to sketch the region defined by linear inequality (e.g., they sketch the region defined by $2 x+6 y<4$ ).
What it means for you: You'll learn how to show the different types of inequality on a graph.
Key words:
- inequality
- strict inequality
- border
- region
Don't forget:
Remember, $\leq$ means "less than or equal to," $\geq$ means "greater than or equal to."
In Topic 4.5.1 you were dealing with regions defined by strict inequalities - the ones involving a $\langle$ or $>$ sign. This Topic shows you how to graph inequalities involving $\leq$ and $\geq$ signs too.
Regions Can Have Different Types of Borders
The region defined by a strict inequality doesn't include points on the border line, and you draw the border line as a dashed line.
For example, the region defined by $y>-x+3$ doesn't include any points on the line $y=-x+3$.

Regions defined by inequalities involving a $\leq$ or $\geq$ sign do include points on the border line. In this case, you draw the border line as a solid line. For example, the region defined by $y \geq-x+3$ includes all the points on the line $y=-x+3$.
Example 1
Graph $2 x-y=-2$ and show the three regions of the plane that include all the points on this line.
Solution
Set of points above and on the line - all these points satisfy the inequality $2 x-y \leq-2$
