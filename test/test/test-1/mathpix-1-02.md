Example 1
Solve $x+9=16$.
Solution
You want $x$ on its own, but here $x$ has 9 added to it.
So subtract 9 from both sides to get $x$ on its own.
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(x+9)-9=16-9 \\
x+(9-9)=16-9 \\
x+0=16-9 \\
x=16-9 \\
x=7
\end{array}
$$
In Example 1, $x=7$ is the root of the equation. If $x$ takes the value 7 , then the equation is satisfied.
If $x$ takes any other value, then the equation is not satisfied.
For example, if $x=6$, then the left-hand side has the value $6+9=15$, which does not equal the right-hand side, 16 .
When you're actually solving equations, you won't need to go through all the stages each time - but it's really important that you understand the theory of the properties of equality.
- If you have a "+ 9" that you don't want, you can get rid of it by just subtracting 9 from both sides.
- If you have a "- 9" that you want to get rid of, you can just add 9 to both sides.
In other words, you just need to use the inverse operations.
Example 2
Solve $x+10=12$.
Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
x+10 & =12 \\
x & =12-10 \quad \text { Subtract } 10 \text { from both sides } \\
x & =2
\end{aligned}
$$
Example
3
Solve $x-7=8$.
Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
x-7 & =8 \\
x & =8+7 \quad \text { Add } 7 \text { to both sides } \\
\boldsymbol{x} & =\mathbf{1 5}
\end{aligned}
$$
