Topic 4.3.2
Point-Slope Formula
California Standards:
7.0: Students verify that a point lies on a line, given an equation of the line.
Students are able to derive linear equations by using the point-slope formula.
What it means for you: You'll learn about the pointslope formula and use it to find the equation of a line.
Key words:
- slope
- point-slope formula

The point-slope formula is just the one from Topic 4.3.1 rearranged. $(x, y)$ is any point on the line, so $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $(x, y)$ are the two points on the line.
The point-slope formula is a really useful way of calculating the equation of a straight line.
Use the Formula to Find the Equation of a Straight Line
If you know the slope of the line and a point on the line, you can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line.
The point-slope formula for finding the equation of a line is:
$$
y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)
$$
where $m$ is the slope and $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ is a point on the line.
You substitute the $x$-coordinate of a point on the line for $x_{1}$ and the $y$-coordinate of the same point for $y_{1}$. Watch out though $-x$ and $y$ are variables and they stay as letters in the equation of the line.
Example 1
Find the equation of the line through $(-4,6)$ that has a slope of -3 .
Solution
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)=(-4,6) \text { and } m=-3 \\
y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right) \\
\Rightarrow y-6=-3[x-(-4)] \\
\Rightarrow y-6=-3(x+4) \\
\Rightarrow y-6=-3 x-12 \\
\Rightarrow y+3 x=-6
\end{array}
$$
