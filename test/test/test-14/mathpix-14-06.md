Growth of Bacteria in a Culture
Suppose the rate of growth of bacteria in a Petri dish is given by
where $t$ is given in hours and is given in thousands of bacteria per hour. If a culture starts with 10,000 bacteria, find a function that gives the number of bacteria in the Petri dish at any time $t$. How many bacteria are in the dish after 2 hours?
Solution
We have
Then, at
we have
so
and we get
At time
we have
After 2 hours, there are 17,282 bacteria in the dish.
5.35 From Example 5.42, suppose the bacteria grow at a rate of
Assume the culture still starts with 10,000 bacteria. Find How many bacteria are in the dish after 3 hours?
