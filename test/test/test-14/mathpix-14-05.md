Analysis
Notice that we did not include the "+ $C$ " term when we wrote the antiderivative. The reason is that, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the antiderivative with If we had chosen another antiderivative, the constant term would have canceled out. This always happens when evaluating a definite integral.

The region of the area we just calculated is depicted in Figure 5.28. Note that the region between the curve and the $x$-axis is all below the $x$-axis. Area is always positive, but a definite integral can still produce a negative number (a net signed area). For example, if this were a profit function, a negative number indicates the company is operating at a loss over the given interval.
Figure 5.28 The evaluation of a definite integral can produce a negative value, even though area is always positive.
