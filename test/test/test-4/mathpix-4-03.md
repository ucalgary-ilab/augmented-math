Figure 6 The slope of a function is calculated by the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$. It does not matter which coordinate is used as the $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ and which is the $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$, as long as each calculation is started with the elements from the same coordinate pair.
Q\&A Are the units for slope always $\frac{\text { units for the output }}{\text { units for the input }}$
Yes. Think of the units as the change of output value for each unit of change in input value. An example of slope could be miles per hour or dollars per day. Notice the units appear as a ratio of units for the output per units for the input.
Calculate Slope
The slope, or rate of change, of a function $m$ can be calculated according to the following:
$$
m=\frac{\text { change in output (rise) }}{\text { change in input (run) }}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$
where $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are input values, $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are output values.
HOW TO
Given two points from a linear function, calculate and interpret the slope.
1. Determine the units for output and input values.
2. Calculate the change of output values and change of input values.
3. Interpret the slope as the change in output values per unit of the input value.
EXAMPLE 3
Finding the Slope of a Linear Function If $f(x)$ is a linear function, and $(3,-2)$ and $(8,1)$ are points on the line, find the slope. Is this function increasing or decreasing?
Solution The coordinate pairs are $(3,-2)$ and $(8,1)$. To find the rate of change, we divide the change in output by the change in input.
$$
m=\frac{\text { change in output }}{\text { change in input }}=\frac{1-(-2)}{8-3}=\frac{3}{5}
$$
We could also write the slope as $m=0.6$. The function is increasing because $m>0$.
