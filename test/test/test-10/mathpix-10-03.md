Constructing Parallel Lines
Parallel lines are lines that lie in the same plane and do not intersect.
The lines in the first pair shown above intersect. They are clearly not parallel. The lines in the second pair do not meet as drawn. However, if they were extended, they would intersect. Therefore, they are not parallel. The lines in the third pair appear to be parallel, but if you extend them far enough in both directions, can you be sure they won't meet? There are many ways to be sure that the lines are parallel.
