EXAMPLE C
If the length of $\widehat{R O T}$ is $116 \pi$ meters, what is the radius of the circle?
- Solution
- Solution
$m \widehat{R O T}=240^{\circ}$, so $\widehat{R O T}$ is $\frac{240}{360}$, or $\frac{2}{3}$ of the circumference.
$$
\begin{aligned}
116 \pi & =\frac{2}{3} C \\
116 \pi & =\frac{2}{3}(2 \pi r) \\
348 \pi & =4 \pi r \\
87 & =r
\end{aligned}
$$
The radius is $87 \mathrm{~m}$.
Apply the Arc Length Conjecture.
Substitute $2 \pi r$ for $C$.
Multiply both sides by 3 .
Divide both sides by $4 \pi$.
