264 Geometric Inequalities
This corresponds to the following transitive property of inequality:
Postulate 7.2
If $a, b$, and $c$ are real numbers such that $a>b$ and $b>c$, then $a>c$.
In arithmetic: If $12>7$ and $7>3$, then $12>3$.
In algebra: If $5 x+1>2 x$ and $2 x>16$, then $5 x+1>16$.
In geometry: If $B A>B D$ and $B D>B C$, then $B A>B C$.
Also, if $\mathrm{m} \angle B C A>\mathrm{m} \angle B C D$ and $\mathrm{m} \angle B C D>\mathrm{m} \angle B A C$, then $\mathrm{m} \angle B C A>\mathrm{m} \angle B A C$.
Substitution Postulate
Consider the substitution postulate as it relates to equality:
- A quantity may be substituted for its equal in any statement of equality.
Substitution also holds for inequality, as demonstrated in the following postulate:
Postulate 7.3 A quantity may be substituted for its equal in any statement of inequality.
In arithmetic: If $10>2+5$ and $2+5=7$, then $10>7$
In algebra: If $5 x+1>2 y$ and $y=4$, then $5 x+1>2(4)$.
In geometry: If $A B>B C$ and $B C=A C$, then $A B>A C$.
Also, if $\mathrm{m} \angle C>\mathrm{m} \angle A$ and $\mathrm{m} \angle A=\mathrm{m} \angle B$, then $\mathrm{m} \angle C>\mathrm{m} \angle B$.
The Trichotomy Postulate
We know that if $x$ represents the coordinate of a point on the number line, then $x$ can be a point to the left of 3 when $x<3, x$ can be the point whose coordinate is 3 if $x=3$, or $x$ can be a point to the right of 3 if $x>3$. We can state this as a postulate that we call the trichotomy postulate, meaning that it is divided into three cases.

Postulate 7.4 Given any two quantities, $a$ and $b$, one and only one of the following is true: $a<b \quad$ or $a=b \quad$ or $a>b$.
