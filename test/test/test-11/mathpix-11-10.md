626 Locus and Construction
EXAMPLE I
a. Draw the graph of $y=x^{2}-4 x-1$ from $x=-1$ to $x=5$.
b. Write the coordinates of the turning point.
c. Write an equation of the axis of symmetry.
d. What are the coordinates of the fixed point and the fixed line for this parabola?
Solution a. (1) Make a table of values using integral values of $x$ from $x=-1$ to $x=5$.
(2) Plot the points whose coordinates are given in the table and draw a smooth curve through them.
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$x$} & $x^{2}-4 x-1$ & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{$y$} \\
\hline-1 & $1+4-1$ & 4 \\
\hline 0 & $0-0-1$ & -1 \\
\hline 1 & $1-4-1$ & -4 \\
\hline 2 & $4-8-1$ & -5 \\
\hline 3 & $9-12-1$ & -4 \\
\hline 4 & $16-16-1$ & -1 \\
\hline 5 & $25-20-1$ & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
b. From the graph or from the table, the coordinates of the turning point appear to be $(2,-5)$. We can verify this algebraically:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & =\frac{-b}{2 a} & y & =x^{2}-4 x-1 \\
& =\frac{-(-4)}{2(1)} & & =(2)^{2}-4(2)-1 \\
& =2 & & =-5
\end{aligned}
$$
c. The axis of symmetry is the vertical line through the turning point, $x=2$.
d. Note that the turning point of the parabola is $(2,-5)$. When the turning point of the parabola $y=x^{2}$ has been moved 2 units to the right and 5 units down, the equation becomes the equation of the graph that we drew:
$$
\begin{aligned}
y-(-5) & =(x-2)^{2} \\
y+5 & =x^{2}-4 x+4 \\
y & =x^{2}-4 x-1
\end{aligned}
$$
The turning point of the parabola is the midpoint of the perpendicular segment from the fixed point to the fixed line. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the equation of the parabola is $1,4 d=1$ or $d=\frac{1}{4}$. The parabola opens
