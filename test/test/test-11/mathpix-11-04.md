156 Congruence of Line Segments, Angles, and Triangles
The correspondence establishes six facts about these triangles: three facts about corresponding sides and three facts about corresponding angles. In the table at the right, these six facts are stated as equalities. Since each congruence statement is equivalent to an equality statement, we will use whichever notation serves our purpose better in a particular situation.

For example, in one proof, we may prefer to write $\overline{A C} \cong \overline{D F}$ and in another proof to write $A C=D F$. In the same way, we might write $\angle C \cong \angle F$ or we might write $\mathrm{m} \angle C=\mathrm{m} \angle F$. From the definition, we may now say:
- Corresponding parts of congruent triangles are equal in measure.
In two congruent triangles, pairs of corresponding sides are always opposite pairs of corresponding angles. In the preceding figure, $\triangle A B C \cong \triangle D E F$. The order in which we write the names of the vertices of the triangles indicates the one-to-one correspondence.
1. $\angle A$ and $\angle D$ are corresponding congruent angles.
2. $\overline{B C}$ is opposite $\angle A$, and $\overline{E F}$ is opposite $\angle D$.
3. $\overline{B C}$ and $\overline{E F}$ are corresponding congruent sides.
In Section 3-5 we saw that the relation "is congruent to" is an equivalence relation for the set of line segments and the set of angles. Therefore, "is congruent to" must be an equivalence relation for the set of triangles or the set of polygons with a given number of sides.
1. Reflexive property: $\triangle A B C \cong \triangle A B C$.
2. Symmetric property: If $\triangle A B C \cong \triangle D E F$, then $\triangle D E F \cong \triangle A B C$.
3. Transitive property: If $\triangle A B C \cong \triangle D E F$ and $\triangle D E F \cong \triangle R S T$, then $\triangle A B C \cong \triangle R S T$.

Therefore, we state these properties of congruence as three postulates:
Postulate 4.1I
Any geometric figure is congruent to itself. (Reflexive Property)
Postulate 4.12
A congruence may be expressed in either order. (Symmetric Property)
