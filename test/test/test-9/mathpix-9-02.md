Solution
(a) To evaluate $f(2)$, locate the point on the curve where $x=2$, then read the $y$-coordinate of that point. The point has coordinates $(2,1)$, so $f(2)=1$. See Figure 5 .
Figure 5
(b) To solve $f(x)=4$, we find the output value 4 on the vertical axis. Moving horizontally along the line $y=4$, we locate two points of the curve with output value $4:(-1,4)$ and $(3,4)$. These points represent the two solutions to $f(x)=4:-1$ or 3 . This means $f(-1)=4$ and $f(3)=4$, or when the input is -1 or 3 , the output is 4 . See Figure 6 .

Determining Whether a Function is One-to-One
Some functions have a given output value that corresponds to two or more input values. For example, in the stock chart shown in the figure at the beginning of this chapter, the stock price was $\$ 1000$ on five different dates, meaning that there were five different input values that all resulted in the same output value of $\$ 1000$.

However, some functions have only one input value for each output value, as well as having only one output for each input. We call these functions one-to-one functions. As an example, consider a school that uses only letter grades and decimal equivalents, as listed in Table 12.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline Letter grade & Grade point average \\
\hline A & 4.0 \\
B & 3.0 \\
C & 2.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
