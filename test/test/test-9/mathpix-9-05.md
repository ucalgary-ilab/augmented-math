HOW TO
Given two points on the curve of an exponential function, use a graphing calculator to find the equation.
1. Press [STAT].
2. Clear any existing entries in columns $\mathbf{L 1}$ or $\mathbf{L 2}$.
3. In L1, enter the $x$-coordinates given.
4. In L2, enter the corresponding $y$-coordinates.
5. Press [STAT] again. Cursor right to CALC, scroll down to ExpReg (Exponential Regression), and press [ENTER].
6. The screen displays the values of $a$ and $b$ in the exponential equation $y=a \cdot b^{x}$.
EXAMPLE 7
Using a Graphing Calculator to Find an Exponential Function
Use a graphing calculator to find the exponential equation that includes the points $(2,24.8)$ and $(5,198.4)$.
Solution
Follow the guidelines above. First press [STAT], [EDIT], [1: Edit...], and clear the lists L1 and L2. Next, in the L1 column, enter the $x$-coordinates, 2 and 5. Do the same in the L2 column for the $y$-coordinates, 24.8 and 198.4.
Now press [STAT], [CALC], [0: ExpReg] and press [ENTER]. The values $a=6.2$ and $b=2$ will be displayed. The exponential equation is $y=6.2 \cdot 2^{x}$.

Applying the Compound-Interest Formula
Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.
The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.
