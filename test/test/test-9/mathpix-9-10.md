Writing Equations of Parabolas in Standard Form
In the previous examples, we used the standard form equation of a parabola to calculate the locations of its key features. We can also use the calculations in reverse to write an equation for a parabola when given its key features.
HOW TO
Given its focus and directrix, write the equation for a parabola in standard form.
1. Determine whether the axis of symmetry is the $x$ - or $y$-axis.
a. If the given coordinates of the focus have the form $(p, 0)$, then the axis of symmetry is the $x$-axis. Use the standard form $y^{2}=4 p x$.
b. If the given coordinates of the focus have the form $(0, p)$, then the axis of symmetry is the $y$-axis. Use the standard form $x^{2}=4 p y$.
2. Multiply $4 p$.
3. Substitute the value from Step 2 into the equation determined in Step 1.
EXAMPLE 3
Writing the Equation of a Parabola in Standard Form Given its Focus and Directrix What is the equation for the parabola with focus $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and directrix $x=\frac{1}{2}$ ?
Solution
The focus has the form $(p, 0)$, so the equation will have the form $y^{2}=4 p x$.
- Multiplying $4 p$, we have $4 p=4\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)=-2$.
- Substituting for $4 p$, we have $y^{2}=4 p x=-2 x$.
Therefore, the equation for the parabola is $y^{2}=-2 x$.

Graphing Parabolas with Vertices Not at the Origin
Like other graphs we've worked with, the graph of a parabola can be translated. If a parabola is translated $h$ units horizontally and $k$ units vertically, the vertex will be $(h, k)$. This translation results in the standard form of the equation
