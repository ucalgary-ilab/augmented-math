CASE $2|x-4|<3$
The solution set of this inequality consists of the values of $x$ that are less than 3 units from 4 in either direction, that is, $x-4$ is less than 3 and greater than -3 .

If $x$ is an integer, the solution set is $\{2,3,4,5,6\}$. Note that these are the integers between the solutions of $|x-4|=3$.
CASE $3|x-4|>3$
The solution set of this inequality consists of the values of $x$ that are more than 3 units from 4 in either direction, that is $x-4$ is greater than 3 or less than -3 .

If $x$ is an integer, the solution set is $\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,8,9,10,11, \ldots\}$. Note that these are the integers that are less than the smaller solution of $|x-4|=3$ and greater than the larger solution of $|x-4|=3$.

We know that $|a|=a$ if $a \geq 0$ and $|a|=-a$ if $a<0$. We can use these relationships to solve inequalities of the form $|x|<k$ and $|x|>k$.
Solve $|x|<k$ for positive $k$
If $x \geq 0,|x|=x$.
Therefore, $x<k$ and $0 \leq x<k$.
If $x<0,|x|=-x$.
Therefore, $-x<k$ or $x>-k$.
This can be written $-k<x<0$.
The solution set of $|x|<k$ is
$$
-k<x<k .
$$
Solve $|x|>k$ for positive $k$
If $x \geq 0,|x|=x$.
Therefore, $x>k$.
If $x<0,|x|=-x$.
Therefore, $-x>k$ or $x<-k$.
The solution set of $|x|>k$ is
$$
x<-k \text { or } x>k .
$$
If $|x|<k$ for any positive number $k$, then $-k<x<k$.
If $|x|>k$ for any positive number $k$, then $x>k$ or $x<-k$.
