I-4 SOLVING ABSOLUTE VALUE EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES
Absolute Value Equations
We know that if $a$ is a positive number, then $|a|=a$ and that $|-a|=a$. For example, if $|x|=3$, then $x=3$ or $x=-3$ because $|3|=3$ and $|-3|=3$. We can use these facts to solve an absolute value equation, that is, an equation containing the absolute value of a variable.

For instance, solve $|2 x-3|=17$. We know that $|17|=17$ and $|-17|=17$ Therefore $2 x-3$ can equal 17 or it can equal -17 .
$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl}
2 x-3 & =17 & \text { or } & 2 x-3 & =-17 \\
2 x-3+3 & =17+3 & & 2 x-3+3 & =-17+3 \\
2 x & =20 & 2 x & =-14 \\
x & =10 & x & =-7
\end{array}
$$
The solution set of $|2 x-3|=17$ is $\{-7,10\}$.
In order to solve an absolute value equation, we must first isolate the absolute value expression. For instance, to solve $|4 a+2|+7=21$, we must first add -7 to each side of the equation to isolate the absolute value expression.
$$
\begin{aligned}
|4 a+2|+7 & =21 \\
|4 a+2|+7-7 & =21-7 \\
|4 a+2| & =14
\end{aligned}
$$
Now we can consider the two possible cases: $4 a+2=14$ or $4 a+2=-14$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
4 a+2=14 \\
4 a+2=-14 \\
4 a+2-2=14-2 \\
4 a+2-2=-14-2 \\
4 a=12 \\
4 a=-16 \\
a=3 \\
a=-4 \\
\end{array}
$$
or
The solution set of $|4 a+2|+7=21$ is $\{-4,3\}$.
Note that the solution sets of the equations $|x+3|=-5$ and $|x+3|+5=2$ are the empty set because absolute value is always positive or zero.
