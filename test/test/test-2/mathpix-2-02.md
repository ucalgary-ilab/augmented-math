Solving Linear Equations - Variation
Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and finding the variation constant.

One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often different events are related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of variation problem, we will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a $k$, describes the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change. There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the first solves for one of the variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the second method.

The greek letter pi $(\pi)$ is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi calculated the value of $\pi$ to seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most accurate value of $\pi$ for the next 1000 years!

If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter you will always get the same value, about $3.14159 \ldots$. If you have a bigger circumference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct variation or directly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to divide to find the constant of variation.
Example 92.
$$
\begin{aligned}
m \text { is varies directly as } n & \text { "Directly" tells us to divide } \\
\frac{m}{n}=k & \text { Our formula for the relationship }
\end{aligned}
$$
In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called indirect variation or inversly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.
Example 93.
$$
\begin{aligned}
y \text { is inversely proportional to } z & \text { "Inversely" tells us to multiply } \\
y z=k & \text { Our formula for the relationship }
\end{aligned}
