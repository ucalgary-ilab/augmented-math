Polynomials - Exponent Properties
Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.
Problems with expoenents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to discover the important properties.

World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin "expo" meaning out of and "ponere" meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)
Example 196.
$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{3} a^{2} & \text { Expand exponents to multiplication problem } \\
(a a a)(a a) & \text { Now we have } 5 a^{\prime} s \text { being multiplied together } \\
a^{5} & \text { Our Solution }
\end{aligned}
$$
A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to just add the exponents: $a^{3} a^{2}=a^{3+2}=a^{5}$ This is known as the product rule of exponents
Product Rule of Exponents: $a^{m} a^{n}=a^{m+n}$
The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. We will add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the following examples
Example 197.
$$
\begin{aligned}
3^{2} \cdot 3^{6} \cdot 3 & \text { Same base, add the exponents } 2+6+1 \\
3^{9} & \text { Our Solution }
\end{aligned}
$$
Example 198.
$$
\begin{aligned}
2 x^{3} y^{5} z \cdot 5 x y^{2} z^{3} & \text { Multiply } 2 \cdot 5 \text {, add exponents on } x, y \text { and } z \\
10 x^{4} y^{7} z^{4} & \text { Our Solution }
\end{aligned}
$$
Rather than multiplying, we will now try to divide with exponents
Example 199.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a^{5}}{a^{2}} & \text { Expand exponents } \\
\frac{\text { aaaaa }}{a a} & \text { Divide out two of the } a^{\prime} s \\
a a a & \text { Convert to exponents } \\
a^{3} & \text { Our Solution }
\end{aligned}
$$
