A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, $(a b)^{3}=a^{3} b^{3}$. This is known as the power of a product rule or exponents.
Power of $a$ Product Rule of Exponents: $(\mathrm{ab})^{m}=a^{m} b^{m}$
It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multiplication inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or subtraction.
Warning 204.
$(a+b)^{m} \neq a^{m}+b^{m} \quad$ These are NOT equal, beware of this error!
Another property that is very similar to the power of a product rule is considered next.
Example 205.
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{3} \text { This means we have the fraction three timse } \\
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \quad \text { Multiply fractions across the top and bottom, using exponents } \\
\frac{a^{3}}{b^{3}} \quad \text { Our Solution }
\end{array}
$$
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to put the exponent on every factor in both the numerator and denominator, $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{3}=\frac{a^{3}}{b^{3}}$. This is known as the power of a quotient rule of exponents.
Power of $a$ Quotient Rule of Exponents: $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{m}=\frac{a^{m}}{b^{m}}$
The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often used together to simplify expressions. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 206.
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\left(x^{3} y z^{2}\right)^{4} & \text { Put the exponent of } 4 \text { on each factor, multiplying powers } \\
x^{12} y^{4} z^{8} & \text { Our solution }
\end{array}
$$
