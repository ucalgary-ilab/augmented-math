2) Of two inlet pipes, the smaller pipe takes four hours longer than the larger pipe to fill a pool. When both pipes are open, the pool is filled in three hours and forty-five minutes. If only the larger pipe is open, how many hours are required to fill the pool?
3) Jack can wash and wax the family car in one hour less than Bob can. The two working together can complete the job in $1 \frac{1}{5}$ hours. How much time would each require if they worked alone?
4) If $\mathrm{A}$ can do a piece of work alone in 6 days and $\mathrm{B}$ can do it alone in 4 days, how long will it take the two working together to complete the job?
5) Working alone it takes John 8 hours longer than Carlos to do a job. Working together they can do the job in 3 hours. How long will it take each to do the job working alone?
6) A can do a piece of work in 3 days, B in 4 days, and $\mathrm{C}$ in 5 days each working alone. How long will it take them to do it working together?
7) A can do a piece of work in 4 days and B can do it in half the time. How long will it take them to do the work together?
8) A cistern can be filled by one pipe in 20 minutes and by another in 30 minutes. How long will it take both pipes together to fill the tank?
9) If $A$ can do a piece of work in 24 days and $A$ and $B$ together can do it in 6 days, how long would it take B to do the work alone?
10) A carpenter and his assistant can do a piece of work in $3 \frac{3}{4}$ days. If the carpenter himself could do the work alone in 5 days, how long would the assistant take to do the work alone?
11) If Sam can do a certain job in 3 days, while it takes Fred 6 days to do the same job, how long will it take them, working together, to complete the job?
12) Tim can finish a certain job in 10 hours. It take his wife JoAnn only 8 hours to do the same job. If they work together, how long will it take them to complete the job?
13) Two people working together can complete a job in 6 hours. If one of them works twice as fast as the other, how long would it take the faster person, working alone, to do the job?
