Rational Expressions - Proportions
Objective: Solve proportions using the cross product and use proportions to solve application problems

When two fractions are equal, they are called a proportion. This definition can be generalized to two equal rational expressions. Proportions have an important property called the cross-product.
$$
\text { Cross Product: If } \frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d} \text { then } \mathrm{ad}=\mathrm{bc}
$$
The cross product tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no fractions that we can solve.
Example 359.
$$
\frac{20}{6}=\frac{x}{9} \quad \text { Calculate cross product }
$$
