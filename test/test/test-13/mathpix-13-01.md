0.9 Parabola
The graph of
$$
y=a x^{2}+b x+c
$$
where $a \neq 0$, is a parabola. The parabola intersects the $x$-axis at two distinct points if $b^{2}-4 a c>0$. It touches the $x$-axis (one intersection point only) if $b^{2}-4 a c=0$ and does not intersect the $x$-axis if $b^{2}-4 a c<0$.
- If $a>0$, the parabola opens upward and there is a lowest point (called the vertex of the parabola).
- If $a<0$, the parabola opens downward and there is a highest point (vertex).

The vertical line that passes through the vertex is called the axis of symmetry because the parabola is symmetric about this line.
To find the vertex, we can use the completing square method to write the equation in the form
$$
y=a(x-h)^{2}+k
$$
The vertex is $(h, k)$ because $(x-h)^{2}$ is always non-negative and so
- if $a>0$, then $y \geq k$ and thus $(h, k)$ is the lowest point;
- if $a<0$, then $y \leq k$ and thus $(h, k)$ is the highest point.
Example Consider the parabola given by
$$
y=x^{2}+6 x+5
$$
Find its vertex and axis of symmetry.
Solution Using the completing square method, the given equation can be written in the form (0.9.1).
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & =x^{2}+6 x+5 \\
y & =\left(x^{2}+6 x+9\right)-9+5 \\
y & =(x+3)^{2}-4 \\
y & =(x-(-3))^{2}-4 .
\end{aligned}
$$
The vertex is $(-3,-4)$ and the axis of symmetry is the line given by $x=-3$ (the vertical line that passes through the vertex).
FAQ In the above example, the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is 1 , what should we do if it is not 1 ?
