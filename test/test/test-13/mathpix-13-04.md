Remark Besides using the completing square method to find the vertex, we can also use differentiation (see Chapter 5 ).
(4) Polynomial Functions A function $f$ given by
$$
f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0},
$$
where $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are constants with $a_{n} \neq 0$, is called a polynomial function of degree $n$.
If $n=0, f$ is a constant function.
If $n=1, f$ is a linear function.
If $n=2, f$ is a quadratic function.
Example Let $f(x)=x^{3}-3 x^{2}+x-1$.
The graph of $f$ is shown in Figure 2.13.
In Chapter 5, we will discuss how to sketch graphs of polynomial functions.
Figure 2.13
The domain of every polynomial function $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$.
There are three possibilities for the range.
(a) If the degree is odd, then $\operatorname{ran}(f)=\mathbb{R}$.
(b) If the degree is even and positive, then
(i) $\operatorname{ran}(f)=[k, \infty)$ if $a_{n}>0$;
(ii) $\operatorname{ran}(f)=(-\infty, k]$ if $a_{n}<0$,
where $k$ is the $y$-coordinate of the lowest point for case (i), or the highest point for case (ii), of the graph.

Remark The constant function 0 is also considered to be a polynomial function. However, its degree is assigned to be $-\infty$ (for convenience of a rule for degree of product of polynomials).
(5) Rational Functions A rational function is a function $f$ in the form
$$
f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)},
$$
where $p$ and $q$ are polynomial functions.
