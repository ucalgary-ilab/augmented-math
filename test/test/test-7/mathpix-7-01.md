36. TT TAKS REASONING A book on the care of tropical fish states that the $\mathrm{pH}$ level of the water should be between 8.0 and $8.3 \mathrm{pH}$ units and the temperature of the water should be between $76^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Let $x$ be the $\mathrm{pH}$ level and $y$ be the temperature. Write and graph a system of inequalities that describes the proper $\mathrm{pH}$ level and temperature of the water. Compare this graph to the graph you would obtain if the temperatures were given in degrees Celsius.
