40. SUMMER OLYMPICS The top three countries in the final medal standings for the 2004 Summer Olympics were the United States, China, and Russia. Each gold medal is worth 3 points, each silver medal is worth 2 points, and each bronze medal is worth 1 point. Organize the information using matrices. How many points did each country score?

TAKS REASONING Matrix $S$ gives the numbers of three types of cars sold in February by two car dealers, dealer A and dealer B. Matrix $P$ gives the profit for each type of car sold. Which matrix is defined, $S P$ or $P S$ ? Find this matrix and explain what its elements represent.
42. GRADING Your overall grade in math class is a weighted average of three components: homework, quizzes, and tests. Homework counts for $20 \%$ of your grade, quizzes count for $30 \%$, and tests count for $50 \%$. The spreadsheet below shows the grades on homework, quizzes, and tests for five students. Organize the information using a matrix, then multiply the matrix by a matrix of weights to find each student's overall grade.
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ C } & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ D } \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Name & Homework & Quizzes & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Test } \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & Jean & 82 & 88 & 86 \\
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & Ted & 92 & 88 & 90 \\
\hline $\mathbf{4}$ & Pat & 82 & 73 & 81 \\
\hline $\mathbf{5}$ & $\mathrm{Al}$ & 74 & 75 & 78 \\
\hline $\mathbf{6}$ & Matt & 88 & 92 & 90 \\

43. MULTI-STEP PROBLEM Residents of a certain suburb commute to a nearby city either by driving or by using public transportation. Each year, $20 \%$ of those who drive switch to public transportation, and $5 \%$ of those who use public transportation switch to driving.
a. The information above can be represented by the transition matrix
$$
T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1-p & q \\
p & 1-q
\end{array}\right]
$$
where $p$ is the percent of commuters who switch from driving to public transportation and $q$ is the percent of commuters who switch from public transportation to driving. (Both $p$ and $q$ are expressed as decimals.) Write a transition matrix for the given situation.
b. Suppose 5000 commuters drive and 8000 commuters take public transportation. Let $M_{0}$ be the following matrix:
$$
M_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{l}
5000 \\
8000
\end{array}\right]
$$
Find $M_{1}=T M_{0}$. What does this matrix represent?
c. Find $M_{2}=T M_{1}, M_{3}=T M_{2}$, and $M_{4}=T M_{3}$. What do these matrices represent?
