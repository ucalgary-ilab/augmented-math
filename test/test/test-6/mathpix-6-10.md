LESSON 14.6
Activity
Graph $y=\sin x$ and $y=1$ on the same screen.
Use viewing window $[0,360]$ by $[-3,3]$ in degree mode.
$\mathrm{Y}=\mathrm{SIN} \quad \mathrm{X}, \mathrm{T}, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathrm{n}$ ENTER $(\mathrm{Y} 2=1$ GRAPH
For Step 2 use viewing window $[0,720]$ by $[-3,3]$.
E X A M P L E 1) Graph $y=\cos x$ and $y=\sqrt{3}-\cos x$ on the same screen, and find any points Page 923 of intersection.
Use viewing window $[0,360]$ by $[-2,3]$ in degree mode.
Graph the functions:
