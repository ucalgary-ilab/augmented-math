Solving Quadratic Inequalities
Why
You can solve many real-world problems, such as those involving business profits related to revenue and cost, by solving quadratic inequalities.
Katie makes and sells T-shirts. A consultant found that her monthly costs, $C$, are related to the selling price, $p$, of the shirts by the function $C(p)=75 p+2500$. The revenue, $R$, from the sale of the shirts is represented by $R(p)=-25 p^{2}+700 p$. Her profit, $P$, is the difference between the revenue and the costs each month.
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(p) & =R(p)-C(p) \\
& =-25 p^{2}+700 p-(75 p+2500) \\
& =-25 p^{2}+625 p-2500
\end{aligned}
$$
For what range of prices can Katie sell the shirts in order to make a profit? That is, for what values of $p$ will $-25 p^{2}+625 p-2500>0$ ? You will answer this question in Example 2.

You will need: a graphics calculator The display at right shows the values of $f(x)=x^{2}-2 x-3$ for integer values of $x$ between -2 and 4 inclusive.
The table suggests the following three cases:
- When $x=-1$ or $x=3, f(x)=0$.
- When $x<-1$ or $x>3, f(x)>0$.
- When $-1<x<3, f(x)<0$.
