Using Combinations and Probability
Recall from Lesson 10.1 that you can find the probability of event $A$ by using the following ratio:
$$
P(A)=\frac{\text { number of outcomes in event } A}{\text { number of outcomes in the sample space }}
$$
In many situations, you can find and evaluate the numerator and the denominator by applying the formula for combinations.

Find the probability that in a random sample of 6 respondents from this survey, exactly 2 favor the proposed regulation and 4 oppose it.
SOLUTION
1. Find the number of outcomes in the event. Use the Fundamental Counting Principle.
2. Find the number of outcomes in the sample space.
$$
{ }_{25} C_{6}<\text { Choose } 6 \text { people from the } 25 \text { respondents. }
$$
3. Find the probability.
$$
\frac{\text { number of outcomes in event A }}{\text { number of outcomes in the sample space }}=\frac{{ }_{17} C_{2} \times{ }_{8} C_{4}}{{ }_{25} C_{6}} \approx 0.05
$$
Thus, the probability of selecting exactly 2 respondents who favor the proposed regulation and 4 who oppose it in a randomly selected group of 6 respondents is about 0.05 , or $5 \%$.
