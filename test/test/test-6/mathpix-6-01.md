In the Activity below, you can see a connection between the concepts of geometric similarity, proportion, and direct variation.

CHECKPOINT
Recall from geometry that similar figures have the same shape. This means that the corresponding angles of similar polygons are congruent, and their corresponding sides are proportional.
1. Copy and complete the table below to compare the lengths of the sides in $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ with the corresponding lengths in $\triangle A B C$.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline Length in $\triangle \boldsymbol{A B C}$ & Length in $\triangle \boldsymbol{A}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{B}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{C}^{\prime}$ & Ratio of $\triangle \boldsymbol{A}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{B}^{\prime} \boldsymbol{C}^{\prime}$ to $\triangle \boldsymbol{A B C}$ \\
\hline$A B=16$ & $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}=24$ & $\frac{A^{\prime} B^{\prime}}{A B}=?$ \\
\hline$B C=20$ & $B^{\prime} C^{\prime}=30$ & $\frac{B^{\prime} C^{\prime}}{B C}=?$ \\
\hline$A C=24$ & $A^{\prime} C^{\prime}=36$ & $\frac{A^{\prime} C^{\prime}}{A C}=?$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
2. Do your calculations in the third column indicate a direct-variation relationship between the lengths of the sides of $\triangle A^{\prime} B^{\prime} C^{\prime}$ and those of $\triangle A B C$ ? Explain your response.
It is said that if $y$ varies directly as $x$, then $y$ is proportional to $x$.
A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. A ratio is the comparison of two quantities by division. A proportion of the form $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$ can be rearranged as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a}{b} & =\frac{c}{d} \\
\frac{a}{b} \cdot b d & =\frac{c}{d} \cdot b d \\
a d & =b c
\end{aligned}
$$
The result is called the Cross-Product Property of Proportions.
Cross-Product Property of Proportions
For $b \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$ :
If $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$, then $a d=b c$.
In a proportion of the form $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}, a$ and $d$ are the extremes and $b$ and $c$ are the means. By the Cross-Product Property, the product of the extremes equals the product of the means.
