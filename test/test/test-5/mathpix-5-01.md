We will apply this method as we subtract the fractions in Example 1.82.
EXAMPLE 1.82
Subtract: - -
Solution
Do the fractions have a common denominator? No, so we need to find the LCD.
$$
\begin{array}{l} 
\frac{7}{15}-\frac{19}{24} \\
15= \\
24=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \\
L C D=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \\
L C D=120
\end{array}
$$
Notice, 15 is "missing" three factors of 2 and 24 is "missing" the 5 from the factors of the LCD. So we multiply 8 in the first fraction and 5 in the second fraction to get the LCD.
Rewrite as equivalent fractions with the LCD.
$$
\frac{7 \cdot 8}{15 \cdot 8}-\frac{19 \cdot 5}{24 \cdot 5}
$$
Simplify.
$$
\frac{56}{120}-\frac{95}{120}
$$
Subtract.
Check to see if the answer can be simplified.
Both 39 and 120 have a factor of 3 .
Simplify.
Do not simplify the equivalent fractions! If you do, you'll get back to the original fractions and lose the common denominator!
TRY IT : : 1.163
Subtract: - -
TRY IT : : 1.164
Subtract: -1
In the next example, one of the fractions has a variable in its numerator. Notice that we do the same steps as when both numerators are numbers.
EXAMPLE 1.83
Add: --
Solution
The fractions have different denominators.
$$
\frac{3}{5}+\frac{x}{8}
$$
