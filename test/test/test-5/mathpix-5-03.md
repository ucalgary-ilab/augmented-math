Solve Applications of Percent
Many applications of percent-such as tips, sales tax, discounts, and interest-occur in our daily lives. To solve these applications we'll translate to a basic percent equation, just like those we solved in previous examples. Once we translate the sentence into a percent equation, we know how to solve it.
We will restate the problem solving strategy we used earlier for easy reference.
HOW TO :: USE A PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY TO SOLVE AN APPLICATION.
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.
Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.
Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.
Now that we have the strategy to refer to, and have practiced solving basic percent equations, we are ready to solve percent applications. Be sure to ask yourself if your final answer makes sense-since many of the applications will involve everyday situations, you can rely on your own experience.
