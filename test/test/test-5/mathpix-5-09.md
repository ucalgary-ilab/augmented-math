HOW TO : : FACTOR POLYNOMIALS.
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?
- Factor it out.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
- If it is a binomial:
Is it a sum?
- Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
- Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.
Is it a difference?
- Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.
- Of cubes? Use the difference of cubes pattern.
- If it is a trinomial:
Is it of the form
? Undo FOIL.
Is it of the form
?
- If and are squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.
- Use the trial and error or "ac" method.
- If it has more than three terms:
Use the grouping method.
Step 3. Check.
- Is it factored completely?
- Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?
Remember, a polynomial is completely factored if, other than monomials, its factors are prime!
