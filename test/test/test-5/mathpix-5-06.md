If you missed this problem, review Example 2.58.
Previously in this chapter we solved several applications with systems of linear equations. In this section, we'll look at some specific types of applications that relate two quantities. We'll translate the words into linear equations, decide which is the most convenient method to use, and then solve them.
We will use our Problem Solving Strategy for Systems of Linear Equations.
HOW TO : : USE A PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGY FOR SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS.
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose variables to represent those quantities.
Step 4. Translate into a system of equations.
Step 5. Solve the system of equations using good algebra techniques.
Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.
Translate to a System of Equations
Many of the problems we solved in earlier applications related two quantities. Here are two of the examples from the chapter on Math Models.
- The sum of two numbers is negative fourteen. One number is four less than the other. Find the numbers.
- A married couple together earns $\$ 110,000$ a year. The wife earns $\$ 16,000$ less than twice what her husband earns. What does the husband earn?
In that chapter we translated each situation into one equation using only one variable. Sometimes it was a bit of a challenge figuring out how to name the two quantities, wasn't it?
Let's see how we can translate these two problems into a system of equations with two variables. We'll focus on Steps 1
