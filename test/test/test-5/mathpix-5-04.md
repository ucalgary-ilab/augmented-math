Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.
- The speed of the local train is $48 \mathrm{mph}$ and the speed of the express train is $60 \mathrm{mph}$.

Wayne and Dennis like to ride the bike path from Riverside Park to the beach. Dennis's speed is seven miles per hour faster than Wayne's speed, so it takes Wayne 2 hours to ride to the beach while it takes Dennis 1.5 hours for the ride. Find the speed of both bikers.

Jeromy can drive from his house in Cleveland to his college in Chicago in 4.5 hours. It takes his mother 6 hours to make the same drive. Jeromy drives 20 miles per hour faster than his mother. Find Jeromy's speed and his mother's speed.

In Example 3.48, the last example, we had two trains traveling the same distance. The diagram and the chart helped us write the equation we solved. Let's see how this works in another case.
EXAMPLE 3.49
Christopher and his parents live 115 miles apart. They met at a restaurant between their homes to celebrate his mother's birthday. Christopher drove 1.5 hours while his parents drove 1 hour to get to the restaurant. Christopher's average speed was 10 miles per hour faster than his parents' average speed. What were the average speeds of Christopher and of his parents as they drove to the restaurant?
Solution
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
- Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening. Below shows a sketch of what is happening in the example.
- Create a table to organize the information.
- Label the columns rate, time, distance.
- List the two scenarios.
- Write in the information you know.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Rate } \\
\text { (mph) }\end{array}$} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Time } \\
\text { (hrs) }\end{array}$} & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Distance } \\
\text { (miles) }\end{array}$ \\
\hline Christopher & & 1.5 & \\
\hline Parents & & 1 & \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{115} \\
\cline { 3 - 4 } & &
\end{tabular}
Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
- We are asked to find the average speeds of Christopher and his parents.
Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
- Complete the chart.
