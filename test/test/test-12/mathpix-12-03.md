CHAPTER 3 DERIVATIVES
FIGURE I
TEC Visual 3.2 shows an animation of Figure 2 for several functions.
V EXAMPLE I The graph of a function $f$ is given in Figure 1. Use it to sketch the graph of the derivative $f^{\prime}$.
SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of $x$ by drawing the tangent at the point $(x, f(x))$ and estimating its slope. For instance, for $x=5$ we draw the tangent at $P$ in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about $\frac{3}{2}$, so $f^{\prime}(5) \approx 1.5$. This allows us to plot the point $P^{\prime}(5,1.5)$ on the graph of $f^{\prime}$ directly beneath $P$. Repeating this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in Figure 2(b). Notice that the tangents at $A, B$, and $C$ are horizontal, so the derivative is 0 there and the graph of $f^{\prime}$ crosses the $x$-axis at the points $A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}$, and $C^{\prime}$, directly beneath $A, B$, and $C$. Between $A$ and $B$ the tangents have positive slope, so $f^{\prime}(x)$ is positive there. But between $B$ and $C$ the tangents have negative slope, so $f^{\prime}(x)$ is negative there.
