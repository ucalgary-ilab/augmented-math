II-I FACTORS AND FACTORING
When two numbers are multiplied, the result is called their product. The numbers that are multiplied are factors of the product. Since $3(5)=15$, the numbers 3 and 5 are factors of 15 .

Factoring a number is the process of finding those numbers whose product is the given number. Usually, when we factor, we are finding the factors of an integer and we find only those factors that are integers. We call this factoring over the set of integers.

Factors of a product can be found by using division. Over the set of integers, if the divisor and the quotient are both integers, then they are factors of the dividend. For example, $35 \div 5=7$. Thus, $35=5(7)$, and 5 and 7 are factors of 35 .
Every positive integer that is the product of two positive integers is also the product of the opposites of those integers.
$$
+21=(+3)(+7) \quad+21=(-3)(-7)
$$
Every negative integer that is the product of a positive integer and a negative integer is also the product of the opposites of those integers.
$$
-21=(+3)(-7) \quad-21=(-3)(+7)
$$
Usually, when we factor a positive integer, we write only the positive integral factors.

Two factors of any number are 1 and the number itself. To find other integral factors, if they exist, we use division, as stated above. We let the number being factored be the dividend, and we divide this number in turn by the whole numbers 2,3,4, and so on. If the quotient is an integer, then both the divisor and the quotient are factors of the dividend.

For example, use a calculator to find the integral factors of 126 . We will use integers as divisors and look for quotients that are integers. Pairs of factors of 126 are listed to the right of the quotients.

When the quotient is smaller than the divisor (here, $10.5<12$ ), we have found all possible positive integral factors.
The factors of 126 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, and 126 .
Recall that a prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive integral factors other than itself and 1 . The first seven prime numbers are $2,3,5$, $7,11,13$, and 17. Integers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers.
