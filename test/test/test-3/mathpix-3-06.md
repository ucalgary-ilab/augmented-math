Volumes of Solids
$\mathbf{2 8 7}$
To understand volume, count the cubes in the diagram on the previous page. There are 3 layers, each containing 8 cubes, for a total of 24 cubes. Note that 3 corresponds to the height, $h$, that 8 corresponds to the area of the base, $B$, and that 24 corresponds to the volume $V$ in cubic units.

A cube that measures 1 foot on each side represents 1 cubic foot. Each face of the cube is 1 square foot. Since each foot can be divided into 12 inches, the area of each face is $12 \times 12$ or 144 square inches and the volume of the cube is $12 \times 12 \times 12$ or 1,728 cubic inches.
1 square foot $=144$ square inches
1 cubic foot $=1,728$ cubic inches
A cube that measures 1 meter on each side represents 1 cubic meter. Each face of the cube is 1 square meter. Since each meter can be divided into 100 centimeters, the area of each face is $100 \times 100$ or 10,000 square centimeters and the volume of the cube is $100 \times 100 \times 100$ or $1,000,000$ cubic centimeters.
1 square meter $=10,000$ square centimeters
1 cubic meter $=1,000,000$ cubic centimeters
EXAMPLE I
A cylindrical can of soup has a radius of 1.5 inches and a height of 5 inches. Find the volume of this can:
a. in terms of $\pi$.
b. to the nearest cubic inch.
Solution This can is a right circular cylinder. Use the formula $V=B h$. Since the base is a circle whose area equals $\pi r^{2}$, the area $B$ of the base can be replaced by $\pi r^{2}$.
a. $V=B h=\left(\pi r^{2}\right) h=\pi(1.5)^{2}(5)=11.25 \pi$
b. When we use a calculator to evaluate $11.25 \pi$, the calculator gives 35.34291735 as a rational approximation. This answer rounded to the nearest integer is 35 .
Answers a. $11.25 \pi \mathrm{cu}$ in.
b. $35 \mathrm{cu}$ in.
