List of ordered triples
three-dimensional. Although such a graph can be drawn, it is too difficult at this time. We can conclude that:
1. Tree diagrams, or lists of ordered elements, are effective ways to indicate any compound event of two or more activities.
2. Graphs should be limited to ordered pairs, or to events consisting of exactly two activities.
EXAMPLE I
The school cafeteria offers four types of salads, three types of beverages, and five types of desserts. If a lunch consists of one salad, one beverage, and one dessert, how many possible lunches can be chosen?
Solution By the counting principle, we multiply the number of possibilities for each choice:
$$
4 \times 3 \times 5=12 \times 5=60 \text { possible lunches Answer }
$$
Independent Events
The probability of rolling 5 on one toss of a die is $\frac{1}{6}$. What is the probability of rolling a pair of 5 's when two dice are tossed?

When we roll two dice, the number obtained on the second die is in no way determined by of the result obtained on the first die. When we toss two coins, the face that shows on the second coin is in no way determined by the face that shows on the first coin.

When the result of one activity in no way influences the result of a second activity, the results of these activities are called independent events. In cases where two events are independent, we may extend the counting principle to find the probability that both independent events occur at the same time.
