$$
\underbrace{a: \overline{b=c}: d}_{\text {extremes }}
$$
or
$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\text { extreme } & \text { mean } \\
\downarrow & \downarrow \\
\frac{a}{b}= & \frac{c}{d} \\
\uparrow & \uparrow \\
\text { mean } & \text { extreme }
\end{array}
$$
In the proportion, $4: 20=1: 5$, the product of the means, $20(1)$, is equal to the product of the extremes, $4(5)$.

In the proportion, $\frac{5}{15}=\frac{10}{30}$, the product of the means, $15(10)$, is equal to the product of the extremes, $5(30)$.

In any proportion $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$, we can show that the product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes, $a d=b c$. Since $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$ is an equation, we can multiply both members by $b d$, the least common denominator of the fractions in the equation.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a}{b} & =\frac{c}{d} \\
b d\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) & =b d\left(\frac{c}{d}\right) \\
b d\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) & =b d\left(\frac{c}{d}\right) \\
d \cdot a & =b \cdot c \\
a d & =b c
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, we have shown that the following statement is always true:
In a proportion, the product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes.

Notice that the end result, $a d=b c$, is the result of multiplying the terms that are cross-wise from each other:
$\frac{a_{2}}{b^{2}}=\frac{c}{d}$
This is called cross-multiplying, which we have just shown to be valid.
If the product of two cross-wise terms is called a cross product, then the following is also true:
In a proportion, the cross products are equal.
If $a, b, c$, and $d$ are nonzero numbers and $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$, then $a d=b c$. There are three other proportions using $a, b, c$ and $d$ for which $a d=b c$.
$$
\frac{a}{c}=\frac{b}{d} \quad \frac{d}{b}=\frac{c}{a} \quad \frac{d}{c}=\frac{b}{a}
$$
For example, we know that $\frac{6}{4}=\frac{15}{10}$ is a proportion because $6(10)=4(15)$. Therefore, each of the following is also a proportion.
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\frac{6}{15}=\frac{4}{10} & \frac{10}{4}=\frac{15}{6} & \frac{10}{15}=\frac{4}{6}
\end{array}
$$
