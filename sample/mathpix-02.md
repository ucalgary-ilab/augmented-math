Equation of Circles Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the circle with center at $C(h, k)$ and radius $r$. Then an equation for $\mathcal{C}$ is

$$
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}
$$

Proof Let $P(x, y)$ be any point on the circle. Since the distance from $P$ to the center $C$ is $r$, using the distance formula, we get

$$
\sqrt{(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}}=r
$$

Squaring both sides yields $(0.8 .1)$.

Example Find the center and radius of the circle given by

$$
x^{2}-4 x+y^{2}+6 y-12=0
$$

Solution Using the completing square method, the given equation can be written in the form (0.8.1).

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{2}-4 x+y^{2}+6 y & =12 \\
\left(x^{2}-4 x+4\right)+\left(y^{2}+6 y+9\right) & =12+4+9 \\
(x-2)^{2}+(y+3)^{2} & =25 \\
(x-2)^{2}+(y-(-3))^{2} & =5^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The center is $(2,-3)$ and the radius is 5 .

FAQ How do we get the number " 9 " etc (the numbers added to both sides)?

Answer We want to find a number (denoted by $a$ ) such that $\left(y^{2}+6 y+a\right)$ is a complete square. That is,

$$
y^{2}+6 y+a=(y+b)^{2}
$$

for some number $b$. Expanding the right-side of (0.8.2) (do this in your head) and comparing the coefficients of $y$ on both sides, we get $2 b=6$, that is, $b=3$. Hence comparing the constant terms on both sides, we get $a=b^{2}=9$.

Summary $a=$ square of half of the coefficient of $y$.
