Example Find equations in general linear form for the two lines passing through the point $(3,-2)$ such that one is parallel to the line $y=3 x+1$ and the other is perpendicular to it.

Solution Let $\ell_{1}$ (respectively $\left.\ell_{2}\right)$ be the line that passes through the point $(3,-2)$ and parallel (respectively perpendicular) to the given line. It is clear that the slope of the given line is 3 . Thus the slope of $\ell_{1}$ is 3 and the slope of $\ell_{2}$ is $-\frac{1}{3}$. From these, we get the point-slope forms for $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ :

$$
y-(-2)=3(x-3) \quad \text { and } \quad y-(-2)=-\frac{1}{3}(x-3)
$$

respectively. Expanding and rearranging terms, we get the following linear forms

$$
3 x-y-11=0 \quad \text { and } \quad x+3 y+3=0
$$

for $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ respectively.

Pythagoras Theorem Let $a, b$ and $c$ be the (lengths of the) sides of a right-angled triangle where $c$ is the hypotenuse. Then we have

$$
a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}

Distance Formula Let $P=\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $Q=\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$. Then the distance $P Q$ between $P$ and $Q$ is

$$
P Q=\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}
