Consider an equation in the form

$$
F(x, y)=0
$$

where $F$ is a function of two variables. The set of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ satisfying (2.3.1) is called the graph of (2.3.1). That is, the graph is the following subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ :

$$
\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}: F(x, y)=0\right\}
$$

Since ordered pairs can be considered as points in the coordinate plane, the graph can be considered as a subset of the plane.

Example Consider the following equation

$$
2 x+3 y-4=0 .
$$

(1) Since $2(2)+3(0)-4=0$, the point (ordered pair) $P(2,0)$ belongs to the graph of the equation.

(2) Since $2(-1)+3(2)-4=0$, point $Q(-1,2)$ belongs to the graph of the equation.

(3) Since $2(1)+3(2)-4=4 \neq 0$, the point $R(1,2)$ does not belong to the graph.

Remark The graph of the equation is the line passing through $P$ and $Q$.

Definition An $x$-intercept (respectively a $y$-intercept) of the graph of an equation $F(x, y)=0$ is a point where the graph intersects the $x$-axis (respectively the $y$-axis).

Example The graph of the equation

$$
2 x+3 y-4=0
$$

is a line. Its $x$-intercept is $(2,0)$ and its $y$-intercept is $\left(0, \frac{4}{3}\right)$. These are obtained by putting $y=0$ and $x=0$ respectively into (2.3.2).

Example The graph of the equation

$$
x^{2}+y^{2}=1
$$

is a circle centered at the origin $(0,0)$ with radius 1 .

The graph has two $x$-intercepts, namely $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$ and two $y$-intercepts, namely, $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$.

Example Find the $x$-intercept(s) and $y$-intercept(s) of the graph of

$$
y=x^{2}-5 x+6
$$

Solution To find the $x$-intercepts, we put $y=0$ in (2.3.3). Solving

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 0=x^{2}-5 x+6 \\
& 0=(x-2)(x-3)
\end{aligned}
