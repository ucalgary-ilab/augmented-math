Polynomials and Negative Powers
California Standards:
2.0: Students understand and use such operations as taking the opposite, finding the reciprocal, taking a root, and raising to a fractional power. They understand and use the rules of exponents.
10.0: Students add, subtract, multiply, and divide monomials and polynomials. Students solve multistep problems, including word problems, by using these techniques.
What it means for you: You'll learn how to find the multiplicative inverse of a polynomial, and how to use negative exponents.
Key words:
- polynomial
- monomial
- reciprocal
- exponent
Before you divide one polynomial by another polynomial, you need to know how to write the multiplicative inverse of a polynomial.
Finding the Reciprocal of a Polynomial
The reciprocal of a polynomial is its multiplicative inverse.
To find the reciprocal of Polynomial A, you divide the number 1 by Polynomial A.
Example
1
Find the reciprocal of each of these polynomials:
a) $2 x-1$
b) $-5 x^{2}+3 x-1$
Solution
a) $\frac{1}{2 x-1}$
b) $\frac{1}{-5 x^{2}+3 x-1}$
By the definition of division, to divide by a polynomial you need to multiply by the reciprocal (the inverse under multiplication) of that polynomial.
Guided Practice
Find the multiplicative inverse of each of these expressions.
1. $a b$
2. $a^{2}$
3. $2 x+4 b$
4. $3 x+1$
5. $8 x^{3}-16 x^{2}+4$
6. $\frac{1}{-2 x^{2}+8 x-9}$
7. $2 x^{2} y^{4}$
8. $\frac{1}{3 a^{2} b^{4} c^{8}}$
9. $\frac{1}{-3 x^{2} y^{8} c^{4}}$
