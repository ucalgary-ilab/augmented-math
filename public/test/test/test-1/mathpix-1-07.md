Using Systems of Equations to Solve Integer Problems
Example 1
The sum of two integers is 53 . The larger number is 7 less than three times the smaller one. Find the numbers.
Solution
First form a system of two equations.
Let $x=$ smaller number
$$
y=\text { larger number }
$$
The sum of the two integers is 53 , so $x+y=53$.
The larger is 7 less than 3 times the smaller one, so $y=3 x-7$.
So the system of equations is $x+y=53$ and $y=3 x-7$.
Now solve the system of equations. The variable $y$ in the second equation is already expressed in terms of $x$, so it makes sense to use the substitution method.
Substitute $3 x-7$ for $y$ in the first equation.
$$
\begin{aligned}
x+y & =53 \\
x+(3 x-7) & =53 \\
4 x-7 & =53 \\
4 x & =60 \\
x & =\mathbf{1 5}
\end{aligned}
$$
Now, substitute 15 for $x$ in the equation $y=3 x-7$.
$$
\begin{array}{l}
y=3 x-7 \\
y=3(15)-7 \\
y=45-7 \\
y=38
\end{array}
$$
That means that the integers are 15 and 38.
The solution should work in both equations:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
x+y=53 \Rightarrow 15+38=53 \Rightarrow 53=53 \text { - True } \\
y=3 x-7 \Rightarrow 38=3(15)-7 \Rightarrow 38=38 \text { - True }
\end{array}
$$
A useful check is to make sure that the answer matches the information given in the question:
- The sum of the two integers is $15+38=53$. This matches the question. - Three times the smaller integer is $15 \times 3=45$. The larger integer is $45-38=7$ less than this.
