Geometric Inequalities
Subtraction of inequalities is restricted to a single case:
Postulate 7.7 If equal quantities are subtracted from unequal quantities, then the differences are unequal in the same order.

However, when unequal quantities are subtracted from unequal quantities, the results may or may not be unequal and the order of the inequality may or may not be the same.
For example:
- $5>2$ and $4>1$, but it is not true that $5-4>2-1$ since $1=1$.
- $12>10$ and $7>1$, but it is not true that $12-7>10-1$ since $5<9$.
- $12>10$ and $2>1$, and it is true that $12-2>10-1$ since $10>9$.
EXAMPLE I
Given: $\mathrm{m} \angle B D E<\mathrm{m} \angle C D A$
Prove: $\mathrm{m} \angle B D C<\mathrm{m} \angle E D A$
Proof
1. $\mathrm{m} \angle B D E<\mathrm{m} \angle C D A$
2. $\mathrm{m} \angle B D E+\mathrm{m} \angle E D C$ $<\mathrm{m} \angle E D C+\mathrm{m} \angle C D A$
3. $\mathrm{m} \angle B D C=\mathrm{m} \angle B D E+\mathrm{m} \angle E D C$
4. $\mathrm{m} \angle E D A=\mathrm{m} \angle E D C+\mathrm{m} \angle C D A$
5. $\mathrm{m} \angle B D C<\mathrm{m} \angle E D A$
Reasons
1. Given.
2. If equal quantities are added to unequal quantities, then the sums are unequal in the same order.
3. The whole is equal to the sum of its parts.
4. The whole is equal to the sum of its parts.
5. Substitution postulate for inequalities.
