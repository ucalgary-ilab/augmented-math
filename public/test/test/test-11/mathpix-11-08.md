Concurrence of the Medians of a Triangle
507
Theorem 12.14
Any two medians of a triangle intersect in a point that divides each median in the ratio $2: 1$.
Given $\overline{A M}$ and $\overline{B N}$ are medians of $\triangle A B C$ that intersect at $P$.
Prove $A P: M P=B P: N P=2: 1$
Proof
Statements
1. $\overline{A M}$ and $\overline{B N}$ are the medians of $\triangle A B C$.
2. $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{B C}$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $\overline{A C}$.
3. Draw $\overline{M N}$.
4. $\overline{M N} \| \overline{A B}$
5. $\angle M N B \cong \angle A B N$ and $\angle N M A \cong \angle B A M$
6. $\triangle M N P \sim \triangle A B P$
7. $M N=\frac{1}{2} A B$
8. $2 M N=A B$
9. $A B: M N=2: 1$
10. $A P: M P=B P: N P=2: 1$
Reasons
1. Given.
2. The median of a triangle is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
3. Two points determine a line.
4. The line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side.
5. Alternate interior angles of parallel lines are congruent.
6. $\mathrm{AA} \sim$.
7. The length of the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is equal to one-half of the length of the third side.
8. Multiplication postulate.
9. If the products of two pairs of factors are equal, the factors of one pair can be the means and the factors of the other the extremes of a proportion.
10. If two triangles are similar, the ratios of the lengths of the corresponding sides are equal.
