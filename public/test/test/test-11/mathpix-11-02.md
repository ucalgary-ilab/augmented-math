EXAMPLE 2
The statement "I go to basketball practice on Monday and Thursday" is true. Determine the truth value to be assigned to each statement.
a. If today is Monday, then I go to basketball practice.
b. If I go to basketball practice, then today is Monday.
c. Today is Monday if and only if I go to basketball practice.
Solution Let $p$ : "Today is Monday,"
and $q$ : "I go to basketball practice."
a. We are asked to find the truth value of the following conditional: $p \rightarrow q$ : If today is Monday, then I go to basketball practice.
On Monday, $p$ is true and $q$ is true. Therefore, $p \rightarrow q$ is true.
On Thursday, $p$ is false and $q$ is true. Therefore, $p \rightarrow q$ is true.
On every other day, $p$ is false and $q$ is false. Therefore, $p \rightarrow q$ is true.
"If today is Monday, then I go to basketball practice" is always true. Answer
b. We are asked to find the truth value of the following conditional:
$q \rightarrow p$ : If I go to basketball practice then today is Monday.
On Monday, $p$ is true and $q$ is true. Therefore, $q \rightarrow p$ is true.
On Thursday, $p$ is false and $q$ is true. Therefore, $q \rightarrow p$ is false.
On every other day, $p$ is false and $q$ is false. Therefore, $q \rightarrow p$ is true.
"If I go to basketball practice, then Today is Monday" is sometimes true and sometimes false. Answer
c. We are asked to find the truth value of the following biconditional: $p \leftrightarrow q$ : Today is Monday if and only if I go to basketball practice.
The conditionals $p \rightarrow q$ and $q \rightarrow p$ do not always have the same truth value. Therefore, the biconditional "Today is Monday if and only if I go to basketball practice" is not always true. We usually say that a statement that is not always true is false. Answer
EXAMPLE 3
Determine the truth value of the biconditional.
