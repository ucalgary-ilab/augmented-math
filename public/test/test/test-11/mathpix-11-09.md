582 Geometry of the Circle
Let the intersection of these two lines be $Q$. Then $\triangle C P Q$ is a right triangle with:
$$
C Q=|x-2| \quad P Q=|y-4| \quad C P=5
$$
We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to write an equation for the circle.
$$
\begin{aligned}
C Q^{2}+P Q^{2} & =C P^{2} \\
(x-2)^{2}+(y-4)^{2} & =5^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
The points $(5,8),(6,7),(-1,8),(-2,7),(-1,0),(-2,1)(5,0)$, and $(6,1)$ appear to be points on the circle and all make $(x-2)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=5^{2}$ true. The points $(7,4),(-3,4),(2,9)$, and $(2,-1)$ also make the equation true, as do points whose coordinates are not integers.
We can write a general equation for a circle with center at $C(h, k)$ and radius $r$. Let $P(x, y)$ be any point on the circle. From $P$ draw a vertical line and from $C$ draw a horizontal line. Let the intersection of these two lines be $Q$. Then $\triangle C P Q$ is a right triangle with:
$$
C Q=|x-h| \quad P Q=|y-k| \quad C P=r
$$
We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to write an equation for the circle.
$$
\begin{aligned}
C Q^{2}+P Q^{2} & =C P^{2} \\
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2} & =r^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
In general, the center-radius equation of a circle with radius $r$ and center $(h, k)$ is
$$
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}
$$
A circle whose diameter $\overline{A B}$ has endpoints at $A(-3,-1)$ and $B(5,-1)$ is shown at the right. The center of the circle, $C$, is the midpoint of the diameter. Recall that the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment whose endpoints are $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are $\left(\frac{a+c}{2}, \frac{b+d}{2}\right)$. The coordinates of $C$ are
$$
\left(\frac{5+(-3)}{2}, \frac{-1+(-1)}{2}\right)=(1,-1) \text {. }
$$
The length of the radius is the distance from $C$ to any point on the circle. The distance between two points on the same vertical line, that is, with the same $x$-coordinates, is the absolute value of the difference of the $y$-coordinates. The length of the radius is the distance from $C(1,-1)$ to $A(-3,-1)$. The length of the radius is
$$
|1-(-3)|=4
