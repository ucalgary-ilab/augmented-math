Marcus will have 380 songs in 12 months.
Analysis
Notice that $N$ is an increasing linear function. As the input (the number of months) increases, the output (number of songs) increases as well.
EXAMPLE 9
Using a Linear Function to Calculate Salary Based on Commission
Working as an insurance salesperson, Ilya earns a base salary plus a commission on each new policy. Therefore, Ilya's weekly income $I$, depends on the number of new policies, $n$, he sells during the week. Last week he sold 3 new policies, and earned $\$ 760$ for the week. The week before, he sold 5 new policies and earned $\$ 920$. Find an equation for $I(n)$, and interpret the meaning of the components of the equation.
Solution
The given information gives us two input-output pairs: $(3,760)$ and $(5,920)$. We start by finding the rate of change.
$$
\begin{aligned}
m & =\frac{920-760}{5-3} \\
& =\frac{\$ 160}{2 \text { policies }} \\
& =\$ 80 \text { per policy }
\end{aligned}
$$
Keeping track of units can help us interpret this quantity. Income increased by $\$ 160$ when the number of policies increased by 2 , so the rate of change is $\$ 80$ per policy. Therefore, Ilya earns a commission of $\$ 80$ for each policy sold during the week.
We can then solve for the initial value.
$$
\begin{array}{l}
I(n)=80 n+b \\
760=80(3)+b \quad \text { when } n=3, I(3)=760 \\
760-80(3)=b \\
520=b \\
\end{array}
$$
The value of $b$ is the starting value for the function and represents Ilya's income when $n=0$, or when no new policies are sold. We can interpret this as Ilya's base salary for the week, which does not depend upon the number of policies sold.
We can now write the final equation.
$$
I(n)=80 n+520
$$
Our final interpretation is that Ilya's base salary is $\$ 520$ per week and he earns an additional $\$ 80$ commission for each policy sold.
EXAMPLE 10
Using Tabular Form to Write an Equation for a Linear Function Table 1 relates the number of rats in a population to time, in weeks. Use the table to write a linear equation.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline number of weeks, $\boldsymbol{w}$ & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 \\
\hline number of rats, $\boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{w})$ & 1000 & 1080 & 1160 & 1240 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
Table 1
Solution
We can see from the table that the initial value for the number of rats is 1000 , so $b=1000$.
