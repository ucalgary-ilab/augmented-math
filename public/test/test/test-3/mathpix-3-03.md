Exploration
STEP I. Write a three-digit multiple of 11 by multiplying any whole number from 10 to 90 by 11 . Add the digits in the hundreds and the ones places. If the sum is greater than or equal to 11 , subtract 11 . Compare this result to the digit in the tens place. Repeat the procedure for other three-digit multiples of 11.
STEP 2. Write a three-digit number that is not a multiple of 11 by adding any counting number less than 11 to a multiple of 11 used in step 1 . Add the digits in the hundreds and the ones places. If the sum is greater than or equal to 11 , subtract 11 . Compare this result to the digit in the tens place. Repeat the procedure with another number.
STEP 3. Based on steps 1 and 2 , can you suggest a way of determining whether or not a three-digit number is divisible by 11 ?
STEP 4. Write a four-digit multiple of 11 by multiplying any whole number from 91 to 909 by 11 . Add the digits in the hundreds and ones places. Add the digits in the thousands and tens places. If one sum is greater than or equal to 11 , subtract 11. Compare these results. Repeat the procedure for another four-digit multiple of 11.
STEP 5. Write a four-digit number that is not a multiple of 11 by adding any counting number less than 11 to a multiple of 11 used in step 4 . Add the digits in the hundreds place and ones place. Add the digits in the thousands place and tens place. If one sum is greater than or equal to 11, subtract 11. Compare these results. Repeat the procedure starting with another number.
STEP 6. Based on steps 4 and 5 , can you suggest a way of determining whether or not a four-digit number is divisible by 11 ?
STEP 7. Write a rule for determining whether or not any whole number is divisible by 11 .
