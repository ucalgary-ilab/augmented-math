Writing About Mathematics
1. A right prism has bases that are regular hexagons. The measure of each of the six sides of the hexagon is represented by $a$ and the height of the solid by $2 a$.
a. How many surfaces make up the solid?
b. Describe the shape of each face
c. Express the dimensions and the area of each face in terms of $a$.
2. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. If the length of a side of an equilateral triangle is $a$, the height is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a$. For the rectangular solid described in exercise 1 :
a. Express the area of each base in terms of $a$.
b. Express the surface area in terms of $a$.
Developing Skills
In 3-9, find the surface area of each rectangular prism or cylinder to the nearest tenth of a square unit.
3. Bases are circles with a radius of 18 inches. The height of the cylinder is 48 inches.
4. Bases are squares with sides that measure 27 inches. The height is 12 inches.
5. Bases are rectangles with dimensions of 8 feet by 12 feet. The height is 3 feet.
6. Bases are isosceles trapezoids with parallel sides that measure 15 centimeters and 25 centimeters. The distance between the parallel sides is 12 centimeters and the length of each of the equal sides is 13 centimeters. The height of the prism is 20 centimeters.
7. Bases are isosceles right triangles with legs that measure 5 centimeters. The height is 7 centimeters.
8. Bases are circles with a diameter of 42 millimeters. The height is 3.4 centimeters.
9. Bases are circles each with an area of 314.16 square feet. The height is 15 feet.
Applying Skills
10. Agatha is using scraps of wallpaper to cover a box that is a rectangular solid whose base measures 8 inches by 5 inches and whose height is 3 inches. The box is open at the top. How many square inches of wallpaper does she need to cover the outside of the box?
11. Agatha wants to make a cardboard lid for the box described in exercise 10 . Her lid will be a rectangular solid that is open at the top, with a base that is slightly larger than that of the box. She makes the base of the lid 8.1 inches by 5.1 inches with a height of 2.0 inches. To the nearest tenth of a square inch, how much wallpaper does she need to cover the outside of the lid?
