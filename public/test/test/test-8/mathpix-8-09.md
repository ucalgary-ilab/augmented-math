Graphs of Trigonometric Functions
When we plot a larger subset of the domain of the sine function, this pattern is repeated. For example, add to the points given above the point whose $x$-coordinates are in the interval $-2 \pi \leq x \leq 0$.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline$x$ & $-2 \pi$ & $-\frac{11 \pi}{6}$ & $-\frac{5 \pi}{3}$ & $-\frac{3 \pi}{2}$ & $-\frac{4 \pi}{3}$ & $-\frac{7 \pi}{6}$ & $-\pi$ & $-\frac{5 \pi}{6}$ & $-\frac{2 \pi}{3}$ & $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ & $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ & $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ & 0 \\
\hline $\sin x$ & 0 & 0.5 & 0.87 & 1 & 0.87 & 0.5 & 0 & -0.5 & -0.87 & -1 & -0.87 & -0.5 & 0 \\

\end{tabular}
Each time we increase or decrease the value of the $x$-coordinates by a multiple of $2 \pi$, the basic sine curve is repeated. Each portion of the graph in an interval of $2 \pi$ is one cycle of the sine function.

The graph of the function $y=\sin x$ is its own image under the translation $T_{2 \pi, 0}$. The function $y=\sin x$ is called a periodic function with a period of $2 \pi$ because for every $x$ in the domain of the sine function, $\sin x=\sin (x+2 \pi)$.
The period of the sine function $y=\sin x$ is $2 \pi$.
Each cycle of the sine curve can be separated into four quarters. In the first quarter, the sine curve increases from 0 to the maximum value of the function. In the second quarter, it decreases from the maximum value to 0 . In the third quarter, it decreases from 0 to the minimum value, and in the fourth quarter, it increases from the minimum value to 0 .
