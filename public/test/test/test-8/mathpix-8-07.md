8-2 LOGARITHMIC FORM OF AN EXPONENTIAL EQUATION
An exponential equation and a logarithmic equation are two different ways of expressing the same relationship. For example, to change an exponential equation to a logarithmic equation, recall that a logarithm or log is an exponent. In the exponential equation $81=3^{4}$, the exponent or $\log$ is 4 . The basic statement is:
$$
\log =4
$$
Then write the base as a subscript of the word "log" to indicate the $\log$ to the base 3 :
$$
\log _{3}=4
$$
Now add the value of the power, that is, log to the base 3 of the power 81:
$$
\log _{3} 81=4
$$
To change from a logarithmic equation to an exponential statement, we must again look for the exponent. For example, in the logarithmic equation $\log _{10} 0.01=-2$, the basic statement is that the log or exponent is -2 . The base is the number that is written as a subscript of the word "log":
$$
10^{-2}
$$
The number that follows the word "log" is the power:
$$
10^{-2}=0.01
$$
Recall that $10^{-2}=\frac{1}{10^{2}}=\frac{1}{100}=0.01$.
In general:
$b^{a}=c$ is equivalent to $\log _{b} c=a$.
EXAMPLE I
Write $9^{3}=729$ in logarithmic form and express its meaning in words.
Solution In the equation $9^{3}=729$, the logarithm (exponent) is 3 :
$$
\log =3
$$
Write the base, 9 , as a subscript of " $\log$ ":
$$
\log _{9}=3
$$
