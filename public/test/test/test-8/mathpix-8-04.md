Repeat the process for the following function, using the numbers $-3,-2,-1,1,2$, and 3 for each function. Find the roots of the function.
a. $\mathrm{f}(x)=x^{3}-2 x^{2}-x+2$
b. $\mathrm{f}(x)=x^{3}-3 x^{2}-4 x+12$
c. $\mathrm{f}(x)=x^{3}-7 x-6=x^{3}+0 x^{2}-7 x-6$ (Include 0 in the list of coefficients.)
d. $\mathrm{f}(x)=x^{4}-5 x^{2}+4=x^{4}+0 x^{3}-5 x^{2}+0 x+4$
5-9 SOLUTIONS OF SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES
A system of equations is a set of two or more equations. The system is consistent if there exists at least one common solution in the set of real numbers. The solution set of a consistent system of equations can be found using a graphic method or an algebraic method.
Solving Quadratic-Linear Systems
A system that consists of a quadratic function whose graph is a parabola and a linear function whose graph is a straight line is a quadratic-linear system in two variables. In the set of real numbers, a quadratic-linear system may have two solutions, one solution, or no solutions. Each solution can be written as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the graph of the parabola and the graph of the line.

Recall that for the function $y=a x^{2}+b x+c$, the $x$-coordinate of the turning point and the equation of the axis of symmetry is $x=\frac{-b}{2 a}$. When $a$ is positive, the parabola opens upward and has a minimum value of $y$ as shown in the figures above. When $a$ is negative, the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value of $y$ as shown in the following example.
