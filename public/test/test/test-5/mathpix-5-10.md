Solution
$$
\frac{8}{x^{2}-2 x-3}+\frac{3 x}{x^{2}+4 x+3}
$$
Do the expressions have a common denominator? No.
Rewrite each expression with the LCD.
\begin{aligned}$x^{2}-2 x-3 & =(x+1)(x-3) \\ x^{2}+4 x+3 & =(x+1)(x+3) \\$\hline FCD & $=(x+1)(x-3)(x+3)\end{aligned}$
Rewrite each rational expression as an equivalent fraction with the LCD.
$$
\frac{8(x+3)}{(x+1)(x-3)(x+3)}+\frac{3 x(x-3)}{(x+1)(x+3)(x-3)}
$$
