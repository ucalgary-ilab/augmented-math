Now let's do this same multiplication using the Vertical Method.
EXAMPLE 6.46
Multiply using the Vertical Method:
Solution
It is easier to put the polynomial with fewer terms on the bottom because we get fewer partial products this way.
Multiply $\left(2 b^{2}-5 b+8\right)$ by b. $\frac{2 b^{3}-5 b^{2}+8 b}{2 b^{3}+b^{2}-7 b+24}$
Add like terms.

TRY IT : : 6.92
Multiply using the Vertical Method:
We have now seen two methods you can use to multiply a trinomial by a binomial. After you practice each method, you'll probably find you prefer one way over the other. We list both methods are listed here, for easy reference.
Multiplying a Trinomial by a Binomial
To multiply a trinomial by a binomial, use the:
- Distributive Property
- Vertical Method
