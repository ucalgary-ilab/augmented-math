Which networks were impossible to travel? Are they impossible or just difficult? How can you be sure? As you do the next few steps, see if you can find the reason why some networks are impossible to travel.
Step 2
Draw the River Pregel and the two islands shown on the first page of this exploration. Draw an eighth bridge so that you can travel over all the bridges exactly once if you start at point $C$ and end at point $B$.
Step 3
Draw the River Pregel and the two islands. Can you draw an eighth bridge so that you can travel over all the bridges exactly once, starting and finishing at the same point? How many solutions can you find?
Step 4
Euler realized that it is the points of intersection that determine whether a network can be traveled. Each point of intersection is either "odd" or "even."
Odd points
Even points
Did you find any networks that have only one odd point? Can you draw one? Try it. How about three odd points? Or five odd points? Can you create a network that has an odd number of odd points? Explain why or why not.
Step 5
How does the number of even points and odd points affect whether a network can be traveled?
Conjecture
A network can be traveled if ?.
