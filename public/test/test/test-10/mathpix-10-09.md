Solution
Solution
The light rays that create the shadows hit the ground at congruent angles. Assuming both the person and the lamppost are perpendicular to the ground, you have similar triangles by the AA Similarity Conjecture. Solve a proportion that relates corresponding lengths.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{5.25}{6} & =\frac{x}{18} \\
18 \cdot \frac{5.25}{6} & =x \\
15.75 & =x
\end{aligned}
$$
The height of the lamppost is 15 feet 9 inches.

3. A $10 \mathrm{~m}$ rope from the top of a flagpole reaches to the end of the flagpole's $6 \mathrm{~m}$ shadow. How tall is the nearby football goalpost if, at the same moment, it has a shadow of $4 \mathrm{~m}$ ? (h)
4. Private eye Samantha Diamond places a mirror on the ground between herself and an apartment building and stands so that when she looks into the mirror, she sees into a window. The mirror's crosshairs are 1.22 meters from her feet and 7.32 meters from the base of the building. Sam's eye is 1.82 meters above the ground. How high is the window?
