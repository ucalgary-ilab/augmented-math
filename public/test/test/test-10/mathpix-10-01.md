The next example shows how to use both kinds of reasoning: inductive reasoning to discover the property and deductive reasoning to explain why it works.
EXAMPLE $\boldsymbol{B} \mid$ In each diagram, $\overrightarrow{A C}$ bisects obtuse angle $B A D$. Classify $\angle B A D, \angle D A C$, and $\angle C A B$ as acute, right, or obtuse. Then complete the conjecture.
$m \angle B A D=120^{\circ}$
$m \angle B A D=158^{\circ}$
$m \angle B A D=92^{\circ}$
Conjecture: If an obtuse angle is bisected, then the two newly formed congruent angles are ?.
Justify your answers with a deductive argument.
Solution
In each diagram, $\angle B A D$ is obtuse because $m \angle B A D$ is greater than $90^{\circ}$. In each diagram, the angles formed by the bisector are acute because their measures$60^{\circ}, 79^{\circ}$, and $46^{\circ}$ - are less than $90^{\circ}$. So one possible conjecture is
Conjecture: If an obtuse angle is bisected, then the two newly formed congruent angles are acute.
Why? According to our definition of an angle, every angle measure is less than $180^{\circ}$. So, using algebra, if $m$ is the measure of an obtuse angle, then $m<180^{\circ}$. When you bisect an angle, the two newly formed angles each measure half of the original angle, or $\frac{1}{2} m$. If $m<180^{\circ}$, then $\frac{1}{2} m<\frac{1}{2}(180)$, so $\frac{1}{2} m<90^{\circ}$. The two angles are each less than $90^{\circ}$, so they are acute.
Science CONNECTION
Here is an example of inductive reasoning, supported by deductive reasoning. El Niño is the warming of water in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which produces unusual weather conditions and storms worldwide. For centuries, farmers living in the Andes Mountains of South America have observed the stars in the Pleiades constellation to predict El Niño conditions. If the Pleiades look dim in June, they predict an El Niño year. What is the connection? Scientists have recently found that in an El Niño year, increased evaporation from the ocean produces high-altitude clouds that are invisible to the eye, but create a haze that makes stars more difficult to see. Therefore, the pattern that the Andean farmers knew about for centuries is now supported by a scientific explanation. To find out more about this story, go to www.keymath.com/DG.
