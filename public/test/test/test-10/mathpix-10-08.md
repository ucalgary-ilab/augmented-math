In Exercises 1-8, find the area of the shaded region. The radius of each circle is $r$. If two circles are shown, $r$ is the radius of the smaller circle and $R$ is the
Construction tools radius of the larger circle.
1. $r=6 \mathrm{~cm}$
4. $r=2 \mathrm{~cm}$
7. $r=2 \mathrm{~cm}$
10. The shaded area is $32 \pi \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Find $r$.
2. $r=8 \mathrm{~cm}$
5. $r=8 \mathrm{~cm}$
8. $R=12 \mathrm{~cm}$ $r=9 \mathrm{~cm}$
11. The shaded area is $120 \pi \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and the radius is $24 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find $x$.
3. $r=16 \mathrm{~cm}$
6. $R=7 \mathrm{~cm}$ $r=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ (h)
9. The shaded area is $12 \pi \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Find $r$.
12. The shaded area is $10 \pi \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The radius of the large circle is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, and the radius of the small circle is $8 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find $x$. (h)
13. Suppose the pizza slice in the photo at the beginning of this lesson is a sector with a $36^{\circ}$ arc, and the pizza has a radius of $20 \mathrm{ft}$. If one can of tomato sauce will cover $3 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ of pizza, how many cans would you need to cover this slice?
