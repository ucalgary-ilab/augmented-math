Review
In Exercises 15 and 16, graph the two lines, then find the area bounded by the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and both lines.
15. $y=\frac{1}{2} x+5, y=-2 x+10(h)$
16. $y=-\frac{1}{3} x+6, y=-\frac{4}{3} x+12$
17. Technology Construct a triangle and its three medians. Compare the areas of the six small triangles that the three medians formed. Make a conjecture, and support it with a convincing argument.
18. If the pattern continues, write an expression for the perimeter of the $n$th figure in the picture pattern.
19. Identify the point of concurrency from the construction marks.

The Squared Square Puzzle
The square shown is called a "squared square." A square 112 units on a side is divided into 21 squares. The area of square $\mathrm{X}$ is $50^{2}$, or 2500 , and the area of square $\mathrm{Y}$ is $4^{2}$, or 16 . Find the area of each of the other squares.
