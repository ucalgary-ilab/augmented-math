Example 216.
$\frac{a^{3}}{a^{5}} \quad$ Using the quotient rule, subtract exponents
$a^{-2}$ Our Solution, but we will also solve this problem another way.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a^{3}}{a^{5}} & \text { Rewrite exponents as repeated multiplication } \\
\frac{a a a}{a a a a a} & \text { Reduce three } a^{\prime} \text { s out of top and bottom } \\
\frac{1}{a a} & \text { Simplify to exponents } \\
\frac{1}{a^{2}} & \text { Our Solution, putting these solutions together gives: } \\
a^{-2}=\frac{1}{a^{2}} & \text { Our Final Solution }
\end{aligned}
$$
This example illustrates an important property of exponents. Negative exponents yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprical the exponent is now positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent does not mean the expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of the base. Following are the rules of negative exponents
$$
a^{-m}=\frac{1}{m}
$$
Rules of Negative Exponets: $\frac{1}{a^{-m}}=a^{m}$
$$
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{-m}=\frac{b^{m}}{a^{m}}
$$
Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule if we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative exponents in the denominator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves, the exponent is now positive. This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 217.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{a^{3} b^{-2} c}{2 d^{-1} e^{-4} f^{2}} & \text { Negative exponents on } b, d, \text { and } e \text { need to flip } \\
\frac{a^{3} c d e^{4}}{2 b^{2} f^{2}} & \text { Our Solution }
\end{aligned}
