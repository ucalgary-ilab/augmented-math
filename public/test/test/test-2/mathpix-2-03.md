Systems of Equations - Mixture Problems
Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems are ones where two different solutions are mixed together resulting in a new final solution. We will use the following table to help us solve mixture problems:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline & Amount & Part & Total \\
\hline Item 1 & & & \\
\hline Item 2 & & & \\
\hline Final & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
The first column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is labeled "part". If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal) in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can multiply the amount by the part to find the total. Then we can get an equation by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us solve the problem and answer the questions.

These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one variable problems.
Example 191.
A chemist has $70 \mathrm{~mL}$ of a $50 \%$ methane solution. How much of a $80 \%$ solution must she add so the final solution is $60 \%$ methane?
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline & Amount & Part & Total \\
\hline Start & 70 & 0.5 & \\
\hline Add & $x$ & 0.8 & \\
\hline Final & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
Set up the mixture table. We start with 70 , but don't know how much we add, that is $x$. The part is the percentages, 0.5 for start, 0.8 for add.
