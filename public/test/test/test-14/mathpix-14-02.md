Let
The first part of the definition begins "For every no matter what positive value of $\varepsilon$ is chosen. By stating "Let
This means we must prove that whatever follows is true we signal our intent to do so.
Choose
The definition continues with "there exists a
" The phrase "there exists" in a mathematical statement is always a signal for a scavenger hunt. In other words, we must go and find So, where exactly did come from? There are two basic approaches to tracking down One method is purely algebraic and the other is geometric.
We begin by tackling the problem from an algebraic point of view. Since ultimately we want we begin by manipulating this expression: is equivalent to
which in turn is equivalent to
Last, this is equivalent to
Thus, it would seem that
is appropriate.
We may also find through geometric methods. Figure 2.40 demonstrates how this is done.
$\delta$ is the length of the smaller of the two distances marked in brown.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\delta & =\min \left\{1+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}-1,1-\left(1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)\right\} \\
& =\min \left\{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right\} \\
& =\frac{\varepsilon}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Figure 2.40 This graph shows how we find
geometrically.
Assume
When has been chosen, our goal is to show that if
then
To prove any statement of the form "If this, then that," we begin by assuming "this" and trying to get "that."
Thus,
