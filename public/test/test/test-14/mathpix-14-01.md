input to exactly one output. For example, let's try to find the inverse function for
Solving the equation
for we arrive at the equation
solutions to this equation for every
$\sqrt{ }$ This equation does not describe
The problem with trying to find an inverse function for
because there are two is that two inputs are sent to the same output for each output The function discussed earlier did not have this problem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a different output is called a one-to-one function.
Definition
We say a is a one-to-one function if when
One way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its graph. If a function is one-to-one, then no two inputs can be sent to the same output. Therefore, if we draw a horizontal line anywhere in the -plane, according to the horizontal line test, it cannot intersect the graph more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from the vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether a graph is the graph of a function. The horizontal line test determines whether a function is one-to-one (Figure 1.38).
Rule: Horizontal Line Test
A function is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph of no more than once.

(b) because it fails the horizontal line test. (b) The function is one-to-one because it passes the horizontal line test.

Determining Whether a Function Is One-to-One
For each of the following functions, use the horizontal line test to determine whether it is one-to-one.
