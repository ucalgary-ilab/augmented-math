To put it another way, the area under the curve between and is (Figure 6.77). The proof that such a number exists and is unique is left to you. (Hint: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove existence and the fact that is increasing to prove uniqueness.)
Figure 6.77 The area under the curve from to is equal to one.
The number can be shown to be irrational, although we won't do so here (see the Student Project in Taylor and Maclaurin Series (http://cnx.org/content/m53817/latest/) ). Its approximate value is given by
The Exponential Function
We now turn our attention to the function Note that the natural logarithm is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse function. For now, we denote this inverse function by
Then,
The following figure shows the graphs of
and
We hypothesize that
Thus, when
For rational values of is rational,
this is easy to show. If
For irrational values of
is rational, then we have we simply define as the
inverse function of
