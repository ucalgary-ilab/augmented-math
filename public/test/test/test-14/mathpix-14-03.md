Sketching a Rational Function
Sketch the graph of
Solution
Step 1. The function is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the domain is the set of all real numbers except
Step 2. Find the intercepts. If then
so is an intercept. If
then -
which implies Therefore, is the only intercept.
Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since is a rational function, divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power in the denominator:
We obtain
Therefore, has a horizontal asymptote of
as
and
Step 4. To determine whether has any vertical asymptotes, first check to see whether the denominator has any
zeroes. We find the denominator is zero when
To determine whether the lines
or
are
vertical asymptotes of
evaluate
and
By looking at each one-sided limit as
we see that
