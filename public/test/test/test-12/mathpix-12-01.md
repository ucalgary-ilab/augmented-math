SYMMETRY
If a function $f$ satisfies $f(-x)=f(x)$ for every number $x$ in its domain, then $f$ is called an even function. For instance, the function $f(x)=x^{2}$ is even because
$$
f(-x)=(-x)^{2}=x^{2}=f(x)
$$
The geometric significance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis (see Figure 19). This means that if we have plotted the graph of $f$ for $x \geqslant 0$, we obtain the entire graph simply by reflecting this portion about the $y$-axis.

If $f$ satisfies $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for every number $x$ in its domain, then $f$ is called an odd function. For example, the function $f(x)=x^{3}$ is odd because
$$
f(-x)=(-x)^{3}=-x^{3}=-f(x)
$$
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 20). If we already have the graph of $f$ for $x \geqslant 0$, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating this portion through $180^{\circ}$ about the origin.
V EXAMPLE II Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither even nor odd.
(a) $f(x)=x^{5}+x$
(b) $g(x)=1-x^{4}$
(c) $h(x)=2 x-x^{2}$
SOLUTION
(a)
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(-x) & =(-x)^{5}+(-x)=(-1)^{5} x^{5}+(-x) \\
& =-x^{5}-x=-\left(x^{5}+x\right) \\
& =-f(x)
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore $f$ is an odd function.
(b)
$$
g(-x)=1-(-x)^{4}=1-x^{4}=g(x)
$$
So $g$ is even.
(c)
$$
h(-x)=2(-x)-(-x)^{2}=-2 x-x^{2}
$$
Since $h(-x) \neq h(x)$ and $h(-x) \neq-h(x)$, we conclude that $h$ is neither even nor odd.
The graphs of the functions in Example 11 are shown in Figure 21. Notice that the graph of $h$ is symmetric neither about the $y$-axis nor about the origin.
