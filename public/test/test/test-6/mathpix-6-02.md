E X A M P L E 2 Find the inverse of each relation. State whether the relation is a function. State whether the inverse is a function.
a. $\{(1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8)\}$
b. $\{(1,5),(1,6),(3,6),(4,9)\}$
SOLUTION
a. relation: $\{(1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8)\}$
inverse: $\{(2,1),(4,2),(6,3),(8,4)\}$
The given relation is a function because each domain value is paired with exactly one range value. The inverse is also a function because each domain value is paired with exactly one range value.
b. relation: $\{(1,5),(1,6),(3,6),(4,9)\}$
inverse: $\{(6,1),(5,1),(6,3),(9,4)\}$
The given relation is not a function because the domain value 1 is paired with two range values, 5 and 6 . The inverse is not a function because the domain value 6 is paired with two range values, 1 and 3 .

Example 3 shows you how to find the inverse of a function by interchanging $x$ and $y$ and then solving for $y$.
E X A M P L E 3 Find an equation for the inverse of $y=3 x-2$.
SOLUTION
In $y=3 x-2$, interchange $x$ and $y$. Then solve for $y$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
x & =3 y-2 \\
x+2 & =3 y \\
\frac{x+2}{3} & =y \\
y & =\frac{1}{3} x+\frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
TRY THIS
Find an equation for the inverse of $y=4 x-5$.
In the Activity below, you can explore the relationship between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse.
Exploring Functions and Their Inverses
CHECKPOINT
You will need: a graphics calculator
1. Graph $y=2 x-1$, its inverse, and $y=x$ in a square viewing window. Use the inverse feature of the calculator. How do the graphs of these functions relate to one another? Consider symmetry in your response.
2. Repeat Step 1 for each function listed at right.
3. Write a generalization about the relationship between
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline Function \\
\hline$y=3 x-2$ \\
\hline$y=3 x+2$ \\
\hline$y=-2 x+5$ \\
\hline$y=x^{2}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse.
