CO N N E C T I O N TRANSFORMATIONS
The function $y=a \sin b(t-c)$, where $t$ is in radians and $y$ represents relative air pressure, can represent a particular sound as follows:
- The amplitude of the graph, $a$, represents the relative intensity of the changes in air pressure. A higher intensity results in a louder sound.
- The frequency of the sound wave, measured in units called hertz (Hz), or cycles per second, determines the pitch of the sound. The value of $b$ in the function is equal to the frequency multiplied by $2 \pi$.
- The phase shift, $c$, represents the change in the position of the sound wave over time.
- The period of the sound wave is the reciprocal of the frequency.

a. Write a transformed sine function to represent this sound.
b. Write a new function that represents a phase shift of $\frac{1}{2}$ of a period to the right of the function from part a. Then use a graphics calculator to graph at least one period of both functions on the same coordinate plane.
SOLUTION
a. The parent function is $y=\sin t$. Write the transformed function in the form $y=a \sin b(t-c)$.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline The amplitude is 3. & $a=3$ \\
\hline The frequency is related to $b$. & $b=2 \pi \times 55=110 \pi$ \\
\hline There is no phase shift. & $c=0$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
Thus, the transformed function is $y=3 \sin 110 \pi t$.
b. The period is the reciprocal of the frequency: $\frac{1}{55}$. One-half of the period is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{55}=\frac{1}{110}$. Thus, a phase shift of $\frac{1}{110}$ radian to the right of the function $y=3 \sin 110 \pi t$ is given by $y=3 \sin 110 \pi\left(t-\frac{1}{110}\right)$. Graph both functions in radian mode.

TRY THIS Write the function for a sound with a frequency of 120 hertz, an amplitude of 1.5 , and a phase shift of $\frac{1}{3}$ of a period to the left. Graph at least one period of the function along with its parent function.
