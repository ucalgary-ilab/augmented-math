The bottle below has a circular base, a flat bottom, and curved sides. There is no geometric formula for the volume of a solid with this shape. In this activity, you will find a polynomial function that models the volume of a solid with this shape.
1. Obtain a bottle with a circular base, a flat bottom, and curved sides. Measure the diameter of the circular base in centimeters. Calculate the radius and the area of the circular base $\left(A=\pi r^{2}\right)$.
2. Pour water into the bottle until the bottle is approximately half full. Place a cap on the bottle, and measure the height, $h_{1}$, in centimeters of the water. The volume in milliliters of the part of the bottle containing water, $W$, can be approximated by $W(r)=\pi r^{2} h_{1}$. Calculate the approximate volume of this part of the bottle.
3. Turn the bottle upside-down, and measure the height, $h_{2}$, in centimeters of the air space above the water. The volume of the air space, $A$, in milliliters can be approximated by $A(r)=\pi r^{2} h_{2}$. Calculate the approximate volume of the air space.
4. The total volume in milliliters of the bottle, $\mathrm{V}$, can be modeled by the function below. Find the total volume of the bottle.
$$
\begin{aligned}
V(r) & =W(r)+A(r) \\
& =\pi r^{2} h_{1}+\pi r^{2} h_{2}
\end{aligned}
