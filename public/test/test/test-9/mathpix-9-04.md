The graph of this function will have the vertical asymptote at $x=-2$, but at $x=2$ the graph will have a hole.

Identifying Horizontal Asymptotes of Rational Functions
While vertical asymptotes describe the behavior of a graph as the output gets very large or very small, horizontal asymptotes help describe the behavior of a graph as the input gets very large or very small. Recall that a polynomial's end behavior will mirror that of the leading term. Likewise, a rational function's end behavior will mirror that of the ratio of the function that is the ratio of the leading terms.
There are three distinct outcomes when checking for horizontal asymptotes:
Case 1: If the degree of the denominator > degree of the numerator, there is a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$.
Example: $f(x)=\frac{4 x+2}{x^{2}+4 x-5}$
In this case, the end behavior is $f(x) \approx \frac{4 x}{x^{2}}=\frac{4}{x}$. This tells us that, as the inputs increase or decrease without bound, this function will behave similarly to the function $g(x)=\frac{4}{x}$, and the outputs will approach zero, resulting in a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$. See Figure 12. Note that this graph crosses the horizontal asymptote.
Figure 12 Horizontal asymptote $y=0$ when $f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}, q(x) \neq 0$ where degree of $p<$ degree of $q$.
Case 2: If the degree of the denominator < degree of the numerator by one, we get a slant asymptote.
