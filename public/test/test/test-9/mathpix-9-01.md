Solution
First, we will write the equation in slope-intercept form to find the slope.
$$
\begin{aligned}
5 x+3 y & =1 \\
3 y & =-5 x+1 \\
y & =-\frac{5}{3} x+\frac{1}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
The slope is $m=-\frac{5}{3}$. The $y$-intercept is $\frac{1}{3}$, but that really does not enter into our problem, as the only thing we need for two lines to be parallel is the same slope. The one exception is that if the $y$-intercepts are the same, then the two lines are the same line. The next step is to use this slope and the given point with the point-slope formula.
$$
\begin{aligned}
y-5 & =-\frac{5}{3}(x-3) \\
y-5 & =-\frac{5}{3} x+5 \\
y & =-\frac{5}{3} x+10
\end{aligned}
$$
The equation of the line is $y=-\frac{5}{3} x+10$. See Figure 7.

Finding the Equation of a Line Perpendicular to a Given Line Passing Through a Given Point Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $5 x-3 y+4=0$ and passing through the point $(-4,1)$.
Solution The first step is to write the equation in slope-intercept form.
$$
\begin{aligned}
5 x-3 y+4 & =0 \\
-3 y & =-5 x-4 \\
y & =\frac{5}{3} x+\frac{4}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$
We see that the slope is $m=\frac{5}{3}$. This means that the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line is the negative reciprocal, or $-\frac{3}{5}$. Next, we use the point-slope formula with this new slope and the given point.
$$
\begin{aligned}
y-1 & =-\frac{3}{5}(x-(-4)) \\
y-1 & =-\frac{3}{5} x-\frac{12}{5} \\
y & =-\frac{3}{5} x-\frac{12}{5}+\frac{5}{5} \\
y & =-\frac{3}{5} x-\frac{7}{5}
\end{aligned}
