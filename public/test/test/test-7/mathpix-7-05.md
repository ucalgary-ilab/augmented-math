EXAMPLE 2 Graph a rational function $(m=n)$
Graph $y=\frac{2 x^{2}}{x^{2}-9}$
REVIEW ZEROS OF FUNCTIONS
For help with finding zeros of functions, see p. 252.
Solution
The zero of the numerator $2 x^{2}$ is 0 , so 0 is an $x$-intercept. The zeros of the denominator $x^{2}-9$ are \pm 3 , so $x=3$ and $x=-3$ are vertical asymptotes.
The numerator and denominator have the same degree, so the horizontal asymptote is $y=\frac{a_{m}}{b_{n}}=\frac{2}{1}=2$.
Plot points between and beyond the vertical asymptotes.
EXAMPLE 3 Graph a rational function $(m>n)$
Graph $y=\frac{x^{2}+3 x-4}{x-2}$
Solution
The numerator factors as $(x+4)(x-1)$, so the $x$-intercepts are -4 and 1 . The zero of the denominator $x-2$ is 2 , so $x=2$ is a vertical asymptote.

The degree of the numerator, 2 , is greater than the degree of the denominator, 1 , so the graph has no horizontal asymptote. The graph has the same end behavior as the graph of $y=x^{2-1}=x$. Plot points on each side of the vertical asymptote.
