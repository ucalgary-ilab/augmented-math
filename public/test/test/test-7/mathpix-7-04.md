Before
You graphed rational functions involving linear polynomials.
Now
You will graph rational functions with higher-degree polynomials.
Why?
So you can solve problems about altitude, as in Ex. 35.

Graphs of Rational Functions
Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be polynomials with no common factors other than \pm 1 . The graph of the following rational function has the characteristics listed below.
$$
f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\frac{a_{m} x^{m}+a_{m-1} x^{m-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}}{b_{n} x^{n}+b_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+b_{1} x+b_{0}}
$$
1. The $x$-intercepts of the graph of $f$ are the real zeros of $p(x)$.
2. The graph of $f$ has a vertical asymptote at each real zero of $q(x)$.
3. The graph of $f$ has at most one horizontal asymptote, which is determined by the degrees $m$ and $n$ of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.
EXAMPLE 1 Graph a rational function $(m<n)$
Graph $y=\frac{6}{x^{2}+1}$. State the domain and range.
Solution
The numerator has no zeros, so there is no $x$-intercept. The denominator has no real zeros, so there is no vertical asymptote.
The degree of the numerator, 0 , is less than the degree of the denominator, 2. So, the line $y=0$ (the $x$-axis) is a horizontal asymptote.

The graph passes through the points $(-3,0.6),(-1,3)$, $(0,6),(1,3)$, and $(3,0.6)$. The domain is all real numbers, and the range is $0<y \leq 6$.
