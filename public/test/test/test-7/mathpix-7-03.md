35. INDIRECT MEASUREMENT The distance $d$ (in miles) that a pilot can see to the horizon can be modeled by $d=1.22 \sqrt{a}$ where $a$ is the plane's altitude (in feet above sea level). Graph the model on a graphing calculator. Then determine at what altitude the pilot can see 8 miles.
36. PENDULUMS Use the model $T=1.11 \sqrt{\ell}$ for the period of a pendulum from Example 3 on page 447
a. Find the period of a pendulum with a length of 2 feet.
b. Find the length of a pendulum with a period of 2 seconds.
(37.) "Thandriseounce The speed $v$ (in meters per second) of sound waves in air depends on the temperature $K$ (in kelvins) and can be modeled by:
$$
v=331.5 \sqrt{\frac{K}{273.15}}, K \geq 0
$$
a. Kelvin temperature $K$ is related to Celsius temperature $C$ by the formula $K=273.15+C$. Write an equation that gives the speed $v$ of sound waves in air as a function of the temperature $C$ in degrees Celsius.
b. What are a reasonable domain and range for the function from part (a)?
