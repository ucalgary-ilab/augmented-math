When we sketch algebraic functions in Chapter 4 , we will see that their graphs can assume a variety of shapes. Figure 17 illustrates some of the possibilities.

An example of an algebraic function occurs in the theory of relativity. The mass of a particle with velocity $v$ is

$$
m=f(v)=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}}
$$

where $m_{0}$ is the rest mass of the particle and $c=3.0 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{s}$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.

\title{
TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
}

Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and also in Appendix D. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always used (except when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function $f(x)=\sin x$, it is understood that $\sin x$ means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is $x$. Thus the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Figure 18.

(a) $f(x)=\sin x$

(b) $g(x)=\cos x$

Notice that for both the sine and cosine functions the domain is $(-\infty, \infty)$ and the range is the closed interval $[-1,1]$. Thus, for all values of $x$, we have

$$
-1 \leqslant \sin x \leqslant 1 \quad-1 \leqslant \cos x \leqslant 1
$$

or, in terms of absolute values,

$$
|\sin x| \leqslant 1 \quad|\cos x| \leqslant 1
$$

Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of $\pi$; that is,

$$
\sin x=0 \quad \text { when } \quad x=n \pi \quad n \text { an integer }
$$
