The graphs of quadratic functions are parabolas.

We therefore predict that the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level will exceed $400 \mathrm{ppm}$ by the year 2019 . This prediction is somewhat risky because it involves a time quite remote from our observations.

POLYNOMIALS

A function $P$ is called a polynomial if

$$
P(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2} x^{2}+a_{1} x+a_{0}
$$

where $n$ is a nonnegative integer and the numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are constants called the coefficients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is $\mathbb{R}=(-\infty, \infty)$. If the leading coefficient $a_{n} \neq 0$, then the degree of the polynomial is $n$. For example, the function

$$
P(x)=2 x^{6}-x^{4}+\frac{2}{5} x^{3}+\sqrt{2}
$$

is a polynomial of degree 6 .

A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form $P(x)=m x+b$ and so it is a linear function. A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form $P(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ and is called a quadratic function. Its graph is always a parabola obtained by shifting the parabola $y=a x^{2}$, as we will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if $a>0$ and downward if $a<0$. (See Figure 7.)

(b) $y=-2 x^{2}+3 x+1$

A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form

$$
P(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d \quad(a \neq 0)
$$

and is called a cubic function. Figure 8 shows the graph of a cubic function in part (a) and graphs of polynomials of degrees 4 and 5 in parts (b) and (c). We will see later why the graphs have these shapes.

(c) $y=3 x^{5}-25 x^{3}+60 x$
